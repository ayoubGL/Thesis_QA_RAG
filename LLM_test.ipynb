In\\nthefooddomain,decision-makingisparticularlycomplexduetothemultifacetednatureof\\nfoodchoices,whichareinfluencedbyarangeofindividual,contextual, andenvironmental\\nfactors. Despite this complexity, recommender systems have shown considerable promise\\nin modeling real world food preferences and supporting users in navigating food related\\ndecisions. Their adoption in food applications has been steadily increasing, reflecting the\\ngrowingimportanceanddifficultyofmakinginformed, personalized, andhealth-conscious\\ndietary choices. Nonetheless, these systems have often been shown to generate predom-\\ninantly popular food options, which tend to be less healthy. As users interact with such\\nsystems, they are repeatedly exposed to unhealthy choices, which in turn reinforces their\\npreferences for these items. This feedback loop causes algorithms to prioritize popular yet\\nnutritionally poor options, ultimately amplifying unhealthy eating behaviors with potential\\nnegative implications for public health. At the same time, digital nudging has emerged as\\na promising strategy for influencing user behavior in subtle and non intrusive ways. How-\\never, limited research has investigated how digital nudges and recommender systems can\\nbeeffectivelycombinedparticularlyinuser-centeredsettingsaimedatsupportinginformed\\ndecision-makingandpromotingbehavioralchange.\\nTo address this gap, this thesis adopts a Design Science Research (DSR) methodology to\\ndesign,implement,andevaluatefoodrecommendersystemsaugmentedwithdigitalnudges.\\nTheresearchisdocumentedacrossseveralpeer-reviewedmanuscriptsandsupportedbyboth\\noffline algorithmic evaluations and online user experiments.

Furthermore,userexperienceisstronglycorrelated\\nwith the system components such as preference elicitation methods and the user be-\\nhaviors, as the extent to which a system facilitates or supports behavioral change is\\ninfluenced by its ability to assist users in efficiently identifying and selecting items\\nthatmeettheirgoalsandpreferences( TintarevandMasthoff ,2007;Pommeranzetal. ,\\n2012). In the context of food recommender systems, the impact of integrating digi-\\ntal nudges on user experience has received relatively limited attention (Trattner and\\nElsweiler, 2017b; Elsweiler et al., 2022). Addressing this gap, the present thesis in-\\nvestigate how digital nudges, integrated into food recommender systems with vari-\\nous preference elicitation techniques, influence key aspects of user interaction, such\\nas satisfaction and overall experience.

This\\nisnecessarytobetterunderstandtheinteractiondynamicsandhowtheyinfluenceoveralluser\\nexperience(Manuscript1).\\nIntegrating digital nudges into food recommender systems has demonstrated clear poten-\\ntial in promoting healthier food choices. However, a surprising finding, is that annotating\\npersonalized recipes with nutritional labels shows a weaker impact on encouraging healthy\\ndecisionscomparedtonon-personalizedrecommendations. Specifically,usersmadehealth-\\nierchoiceswhenpresentedwithrandomlygeneratedrecipeoptionsratherthanpersonalized\\nones. This supports existing concerns that personalization may inadvertently reinforce un-\\nhealthy behaviors, likely due to the widespread availability of popular, yet less nutritious,\\nrecipes online and users’ natural inclination toward such options (Trattner and Elsweiler,\\n2017a; Elahi et al., 2021; Trattner et al., 2019). These tendencies may be rooted in our\\nevolutionary predisposition for calorie-dense foods and the development of unhealthy food\\npreferencesfromanearlyage( Beckermanetal. ,2017;Waynforth,2010).\\nConversely, users with specific dietary goals demonstrated more deliberate behavior and\\ngreater intention in their food choices. They also perceived nutritional nudges as more\\nhelpful in aligning with their health objectives (Manuscript 2). In so-called “boost” sce-\\nnarios(Manuscript3),whereuserswereexplicitlyinformedaboutthemeaningandfunction\\nof the nudges, they exhibited a stronger understanding and were more likely to apply the\\nnutritionalinformationeffectively,leadingtohealthierdecisions. Thishighlightsthecritical\\nrole of understandability and user knowledge in shaping how users interact with recom-\\nmender systems (Gedikli et al., 2014). Understandability not only enhances user trust and\\nengagement but also enables users to make more informed and autonomous choices, key\\nprinciples in boosting strategies, which differ from nudging approaches (Grüne-Yanoff and\\nHertwig,2016). Whenuserscomprehendwhyarecommendationismadeandhowthesys-\\ntem operates, they can better evaluate the relevance of the recommendation to their goals,\\nparticularlyinhealth-relatedcontexts( Dietvorstetal. ,2015;TintarevandMasthoff ,2012).\\nHowever, this enhanced transparency and user engagement can also introduce biases. For\\nexample, providing too much control or explanation may lead to confirmation bias, where\\nusersseekinformationthatconfirmstheirexistingpreferences,evenifthosepreferencesare\\nunhealthy(SchwindandBuder ,2012). Similarly,userswithpriorbeliefsaboutfoodornu-\\ntrition might interpret nudges in line with those beliefs, diminishing their effectiveness or\\nreinforcingexistingmisconceptions( Hauseretal. ,2018).',\n",
       " '4.7Discussions 37\\nTherefore, while boosting understandability and knowledge improves decision quality in\\nmany cases, system designers must find a balance to avoid overfitting to users’ existing\\nmentalmodelsorreinforcingunhealthypatterns.\\nAnother central finding is that knowledge-based preference elicitation methods were more\\neffectiveinguidinguserstowardhealthierrecipescomparedtocontent-basedmethods. This\\nmirrors findings from adjacent domains (Starke et al.,2021b;Knijnenburg and Willemsen,\\n2009), where users with domain expertise benefit more from attribute-based interactions\\nduetotheirabilitytoarticulatestructuredpreferences. Similarly,food-knowledgeableusers\\nreported higher satisfaction and lower cognitive effort when interacting with knowledge-\\nbasedsystems,reinforcingtheimportanceofaligningsystemcomplexitywithusercompe-\\ntence(Manuscript4).\\nMoreover, user choice and the perceived attractiveness of food images are influenced by\\nmultiplefactors,includingbothuserintentionsandthevisualfeaturesoftheimages. Thus,\\nthe way content is presented shown to play an essential role in shaping user choices and\\nsupporting healthier, more informed decision-making. Overall, the findings demonstrate\\nthat preference elicitation methods, interface design, and digital nudges significantly affect\\nuser evaluation and experience within recommender systems. The interplay between user\\nknowledge and the type of preference elicitation method emerged as particularly critical,\\nemphasizing that adaptive and personalized interaction designs can enhance both the per-\\nceived usefulness and overall effectiveness of food recommender systems (Manuscript 4,\\nManuscript5,Manuscript6).\\n4.7.2 On the Limitations\\nThe promising findings of this project pave the way for a deeper understanding and more\\neffective evaluation of recommender systems and digital nudging interventions aimed at\\nsupporting users in making healthier and more informed decisions. While the use of the\\nDesignScienceResearchmethodologyofferedastructuredandrigorousframeworkforsys-\\ntemdevelopmentandevaluation,therelianceononlineuserexperimentsandcrowdsourcing\\nplatforms may not fully capture real-world food decision-making behaviors.

INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION\\nRecommender systems areregarded as fundamental technol-\\nogy for running major apps to websites and significant digital\\nfood platforms [1]–[3]. Recommender systems help users to\\nnavigate the problem of choice overload [4], [5], reducing\\nthe choice set of relevant options and presenting content to a\\nuser they may like or be interested in. The primary filtering\\nmechanism of a recommender system is the analysis of past\\nuser-item interactions, assuming that previously liked items\\nwill also be liked by a user in the forthcoming interactions\\n[6].\\nRecommender systems are integrated across various do-\\nmains. They have been shown to positively impact both users\\nand service providers positively [7]–[9]. Whereas in many\\ndomains they focus on hedonic or taste-driven goals, such as\\nfinding music to listen or products to buy, food is often more\\nversatile, with users also pursuing goals related to nutrition\\nand sustainability [10], [11].\\nRecommender systems can play an important role in digi-\\ntal health promotion [12]. The World Health Organization re-\\nports that the global number of overweight adults has reached\\napproximately 2.3 billion in recent decades [13], with over-\\nweight and obesity being significant contributors to the rising\\nprevalence of chronic diseases [14] due to primarily un-\\nhealthy eating. Given these alarming statistics, recommender\\nsystems can be designed to support food choices [15]. They\\nmainly simplify the selection process through personalized\\nsuggestions—from meal recipes to restaurant recommenda-\\ntions. Despite their potential benefits, implementing those\\nsystems faces inherent challenges due to the complexity\\nof food choices, which are shaped by item characteristics,\\nindividual preferences, contextual variables, user mood, and\\nsocial environments.\\nHuman food choices are influenced by a range of determi-\\nnants [16]. These include more biological factors [17], such\\nas basic tastes (e.g. sweet, salty, bitter, and sour) and olfactory\\nsenses, which shape our perception of food flavor. These\\nbiological influences are mediated by genetic factors [17],\\nVOLUME 4, 2016 1',\n",

Additionally, ex-\\nternal factors also significantly impact food choices. This\\nincludes social and environmental influences [16], [18], such\\nas attitudes, beliefs, motivations, values, social status, and\\ninterpersonal relationships [19], [20]. The knowledge and\\nskills acquired throughout an individual’s life further affect\\ndietary decisions [18], [19], [21]. Furthermore, shifts in\\nglobal food systems have led to changes in eating patterns,\\ncontributing to an increase in the consumption of unhealthy\\nfoods [20]. Despite the substantial body of research across\\nvarious disciplines, the combined factors in food choice and\\nbehavior remain difficult to predict [22], [23].\\nRecommender systems have significantly advanced the\\nmodeling of food choice behavior. They apply sophisticated\\nstatistical and mathematical models in conjunction with in-\\nformation retrieval techniques [24]. However, not all interac-\\ntion factors can be effectively modeled [25]. Figure 1 illus-\\ntrates the traditional process of a food recommender system,\\nhighlighted in grey, as originally presented by Elsweiler et\\nal. [24]. It demonstrates how various food choice factors\\ncan be integrated into the modeling of such systems. These\\nsystems typically feed user characteristics and food attributes\\n(cf. Figure 1, Part (A)) as inputs to predefined algorithms\\nand recommendations approaches (cf. Figure 1, Part (B)) to\\ngenerate personalized food recommendations. The goals of\\nthese systems vary, from recommending ingredients similar\\nto those preferred by the user to offering recipe suggestions\\nbased on past user ratings [12]. In later research, food rec-\\nommender systems have started to incorporate nutritional\\ncontent or generating tailored nutritional advice based on\\nusers’ health conditions. Despite these advancements, efforts\\nto optimize recommendations for health outcomes have re-\\nmained limited. For example, Chen et al. [26] focuses on how\\nnutrition data, such as calorie content and nutrient balance,\\ncan improve the health value of recommended recipes. Nev-\\nertheless, current literature suggests that food recommender\\nsystems tend to prioritize popular content, which is often\\nassociated with unhealthy dietary standards. [27]–[29].\\nWhile recommender algorithms focus on the generation of\\ncontent, how this content presented also significantly impacts\\nuser preferences. These preferences are often context de-\\npendent [30] and can be influenced by various presentations\\nfactors (see Figure 1, Part C). Such factors present an oppor-\\ntunity to guide users towards healthier food choices, thereby\\nby enhancing the overall effectiveness of food recommender\\nsystems [11], [31], [32]. Any changes made to an interface\\n(i.e., choice architecture) that lead to predictable choices,\\ne.g., due to cognitive biases, are called ’nudges’. Originally\\nintroduced by behavioral economists Richard Thaler and\\nCass Sunstein, nudges were primarily examined in offline\\ndecision-making contexts and have successfully supported\\ninformed choices related to health and wealth [33], [34].\\nThe successful application of nudging techniques in physical\\nenvironments has generated significant interest in exploring\\ntheir potential within digital contexts. In 2016, Weinmann et\\nal. [35] introduced the concept of \"digital nudges,\" defining\\nthem as interventions designed to modify user interfaces\\nin ways that steer user behavior toward desired outcomes.\\nDigital nudging has been increasingly adopted across various\\nonline platforms. For example, social norm nudges aimed at\\npromoting daily walking have been shown to produce mean-\\ningful changes in user behavior [36]. Similarly, interventions\\non online grocery platforms have demonstrated considerable\\nefficacy in fostering more sustainable and environmentally\\nconscious purchasing decisions [37]. Furthermore, reposi-\\ntioning nudges within online food ordering systems have\\nbeen associated with a significant increase in the selection\\nof healthier food options [38].\\nRecent research on recommender systems has begun ex-\\nploring the integration of digital nudges to promote be-\\nhavioral change and deliver personalized content [39]. For\\ninstance, incorporating an explanatory nudge into a food\\nrecommender system has been shown to positively influ-\\nence users’ selection of healthier recommendations [40].\\nSimilarly, enhancing user awareness of the healthiness of\\nrecommended recipes through the use of multi-color coding\\nas a nudge has been found to encourage healthier food\\nchoices [41]. In line with these findings, the inclusion of visu-\\nally appealing images alongside healthy recipes significantly\\nincreases the likelihood that users will select these options in\\na search-based recipe recommender system [42].\\nThis research aims to investigate how digital nudges have\\nbeen integrated into food recommender systems to promote\\nhealthier food choices. More specifically, it seeks to present\\ndigital nudging techniques that effectively promote healthier\\nfood choices within these systems. Additionally, the study\\nwill explore techniques that warrant further investigation\\nfor their potential in this area. To guide the research, the\\nfollowing primary research question has been formulated:\\n• RQ: How can digital nudges be integrated into recom-\\nmender technology to effectively support users to make\\nhealthier food choices?\\nTo systematically organize our study around the main re-\\nsearch question, we propose the following sub-research ques-\\ntions:\\n• How have digital nudges been integrated in recom-\\nmender systems to support healthier food choices?\\n• What are the potential future applications of nudges in\\nrecommender systems for healthier food choices?\\nThe paper is organized as follows.

The following sub-sections\\nprovide a background on current (i) food choice theory, (ii)\\nfood recommender system approaches, and (iii) digital food\\nnudges on platforms that not yet been integrated into food\\nrecommender systems.\\nA. FOOD CHOICE THEORY\\nHuman food choice is an iterative process governed by\\ndynamic factors that integrate multiple interacting determi-\\nnants [43]–[45]. The interacting factors can be categorized\\ninto those pertaining to the individual, the food item, and the\\nbroader environmental or situational context, as articulated in\\none of the foundational models of food choice [46].\\nIndividual factors influencing food choice are typically\\ncategorized into several dimensions. Personal state factors\\ninclude genetic predispositions, dietary patterns, and physical\\nhealth conditions. Psychological factors encompass hunger,\\nappetite, and body weight, along with emotional, motiva-\\ntional, and personality characteristics [43]. Additionally, per-\\nsonal habits and past experiences contribute significantly to\\nshaping these personal states [47]. The cognitive aspects of\\nfood choice are also critical, going beyond mere knowl-\\nedge and skills to include preferences, personal identity,\\nand sensory evaluations, thus adding complexity to food-\\nrelated decision-making processes [48]. Attitudes represent\\nimplicit evaluations of food, whereas liking refers to the\\nsensory evaluation of food’s appeal. Preferences are based\\non relative evaluations of different food options. A third cog-\\nnitive dimension is the anticipated outcomes of food choices,\\nparticularly in terms of perceived health risks or benefits [49],\\n[50].\\nConversely, food items are shaped by a combination of\\nintrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors pertain to the\\ninherent properties of the food itself, encompassing sensory\\nattributes such as flavor, taste, aroma, and texture, along\\nwith perceptual features like color, portion size, nutritional\\ncontent, health benefits, and overall quality [46], [47]. In\\ncontrast, extrinsic factors are bifurcated into informational\\nand environmental categories. Informational factors involve\\nknowledge related to the food, including its origin, nutritional\\nprofile, and composition. Additionally, the social environ-\\nment influences food choices directly and indirectly through\\ncultural norms, culinary practices, and the social context of\\nconsumption, such as specific occasions. The physical envi-\\nronment also plays a pivotal role in determining food avail-\\nability and accessibility, significantly affecting food choice\\nbehavior [47], [51].\\nComprehensive models have been developed to explain the\\nfactors influencing food choice and decision-making. Sobal\\net al. [44] model suggests that personal, resource, and con-\\nVOLUME 4, 2016 3',\n",
       " 'EL Majjodiet al.: Integrating Digital Food Nudges and Recommender Systems: Current Status and Future Directions\\ntextual factors shape personal food systems based on values,\\nsituations, and strategies, which in turn influence food behav-\\nior in a feedback loop [52]. Connors et al. [53] expanded this\\nmodel by emphasizing the role of life course experiences,\\nideals, and social context in shaping food behavior through\\nsimilar feedback mechanisms. Sensory factors and packaging\\ninformation can also trigger emotional responses that directly\\naffect the final food choice [54]. Understanding these interre-\\nlated factors is key to promoting healthier eating, with critical\\ndeterminants including food mavenism, knowledge, market\\navailability, and personal norms [55]–[57].\\nThe complexity of explaining final food choices arises\\nfrom the aforementioned interacting factors and other var-\\nious determinants [20]. Within the field of recommender\\nsystems, the primary focus has been on modeling user food\\npreferences to identify the most appealing recipes, meals, or\\nproducts. This process is typically framed as a prediction\\ntask. Additionally, time and contextual factors have been\\nmodeled to a significant extent within food recommendation\\nprocesses [58]. However, a notable research gap exists be-\\ntween offline food choice theories and the factors that guide\\nuser preferences in digital food recommender systems [12].\\nB. THE CURRENT STATUS IN FOOD RECOMMENDER\\nSYSTEMS\\nRecommendation technology is typically divided into differ-\\nent recommendation approach categories: collaborative fil-\\ntering, content-based, knowledge-based, and hybrid methods.\\nEach of these approaches leverages interactions between the\\nuser and the content data [6], but they differ in how this\\nis achieved. In the food domain, these methods are utilized\\nto learn user preferences and retrieve relevant food items.\\nFor most content-based and knowledge-based approach, food\\nitems (e.g., recipes) tend to be represented in terms of their\\nattributes, such as ingredients, cooking directions, and basic\\nname-based metadata [25], [59].\\nCollaborative filtering algorithms rely on identifying simi-\\nlarities between user profiles to generate recommendations.\\nThese methods operate on the assumption that users with\\nsimilar preferences and interests are likely to be interested\\nin the same items [6], [60]. By integrating taste factors\\ninto user profiles alongside previous ratings, a collaborative-\\nbased food recommender system can be developed, offering\\nimproved precision compared to traditional linear regression\\nmodels [61]. Moreover, a relevant and specific diet tailored\\nto individual users in collaborative-based approaches using\\nneighborhood algorithms leads to 85% recommendation ac-\\ncuracy [62].\\nOver the past decades, content-based food recommen-\\ndation methods have been the most widely utilized in the\\nliterature [59]. The primary distinction of these methods lies\\nin their generation of recommendations through a more in-\\ndepth analysis and semantic understanding of item content\\nand user preferences [63]. The item content is represented\\nby features that can range from ingredients to images of\\nprepared dishes. Thus, recommendations are retrieved based\\non a similarity function that matches the features in a user’s\\nprofile with those in the system’s database.\\nKnowledge-based recommenders use a different approach.\\nDesigners of such systems leverage domain knowledge to\\nscore items based on elicited user characteristics and pref-\\nerences [6], [64]. For example, Cataldo et al. [64] present\\na knowledge-based food recommender that personalizes\\nrecipes by incorporating users’ health-related characteristics\\nand personal factors, such as BMI and dietary restrictions.\\nSuch approaches would present food content that matches a\\nuser’s nutritional needs [31]. Knowledge-based approaches\\nare less commonly employed mainly because they limit the\\nfood exploration of food options by requiring users to define\\nspecific attributes or constraints [3], [25], [65]. The database\\nitems are narrowed down according to user criteria and filters,\\nresulting in a selection of predefined food items.\\nHybrid recommender systems, as the name suggests, in-\\ntegrate multiple recommendation techniques or components\\ninto a single approach [6]. This technique is typically used\\nto reduce limitations present any specific approach, such as\\nthe reduced novelty in content-based recommenders [11].\\nHybrid systems have shown to enhance both accuracy and\\nperformance by drawing on recommendations from diverse\\nsources of information. Pallavi Chavan et al. [66] demon-\\nstrated that hybrid food recommender approach outperform\\ncollaborative and content-based filtering regarding recall and\\naccuracy, as they benefit from the comprehensive content\\nanalysis inherent in traditional methods.\\nC. DIGITAL FOOD NUDGES\\nBeyond recommender algorithms, there is more that can be\\ndesigned and personalized in a recommender system. The\\ninterface is particularly interesting as different presented\\noptions can be reorganized to elicit predictable behavior\\namong users. Hence, users have specific cognitive biases that\\ncan be leveraged to steer decision-making towards specific\\noptions [67], [68].\\nThis is where nudging theory can play a role in the\\ndesign of such interfaces. the term \"Nudge\" encompasses\\nvarious techniques used to support people’s behavior and\\novercome decision biases and heuristics inherent in human\\nthinking systems based on the choice architect in the offline\\nsettings. Such techniques have been proven to support and\\nguide informed decision-making across different domains,\\nincluding the health sector, policy-making, environment, and\\neducation [68], [69].\\nIn the context of food choice environments, it is possible\\nto influence individuals to, for example, select healthier\\noptions by reducing the perceived effort required during\\ndecision-making [70]. This can be achieved by presenting the\\nhealthier choice as the more convenient or accessible [71].\\nThe effectiveness of such nudging strategies within physical\\nfood environments has been demonstrated in various studies.\\nFor instance, research by Bucher et al. [71] has shown that\\nincreasing the physical distance of a food option decreases\\nits selection. Cadario et al. [72] introduces a conceptually\\n4 VOLUME 4, 2016',\n",
       " 'EL Majjodiet al.: Integrating Digital Food Nudges and Recommender Systems: Current Status and Future Directions\\ngrounded framework that classifies healthy eating nudges\\ninto three distinct, theory-based categories. This framework\\noffers a systematic approach to understanding and differ-\\nentiating between various nudging interventions to promote\\nhealthier eating behaviors. Each category within the frame-\\nwork is anchored in established theoretical principles [33],\\nenabling researchers and practitioners to discern the under-\\nlying mechanisms through which each type of nudge exerts\\nits influence. Accordingly, in the present work, we will utilize\\nthis framework to categorize the nudging techniques found in\\nliterature into three classes, aligning them with the following\\ncategorization defined by Cadario et al. [72]:\\n• Affectively oriented nudges : Nudging techniques that\\nencompass interventions designed to enhance the he-\\ndonic appeal of healthy food options. This category\\nincludes strategies such as “hedonic enhancements”,\\nwhich aim to increase the sensory attractiveness of\\nhealthier choices through vivid descriptions, appealing\\ndisplays, enticing photographs, or aesthetically pleas-\\ning containers. Additionally, this category incorporates\\n\"healthy eating calls,\" which are direct appeals that\\nencourage individuals to make healthier choices.\\n• Cognitively oriented nudges: This category includes two\\ntypes of nutritional labeling: “descriptive nutritional\\nlabeling”, which offers detailed information such as\\ncalorie counts or the content of other nutrients, and\\n“evaluative nutritional labeling”, which simplifies the\\nassessment of food items’ healthiness through color-\\ncoded indicators (e.g., red, yellow, green). A third tech-\\nnique within this category is “visibility enhancement”,\\nwhich aims to inform consumers of the availability of\\nhealthier options by increasing their prominence within\\na food setting.\\n• Behavioural oriented nudges: Interventions that aim to\\nimpact people’s behaviors without necessarily influenc-\\ning what they know or how they feel often without\\npeople being aware of their existence.\\nIn the contemporary landscape, most human decision-\\nmaking is made through digital platforms, such as websites\\nand mobile applications [73]. However, individuals are par-\\nticularly susceptible to making suboptimal decisions within\\nthese digital environments. Drawing on the theoretical prin-\\nciples of nudging, Weinmann [35], introduced the concept of\\n\"digital nudging\" as the use interface design elements to steer\\nindividuals’ choices or shape users’ decisions in online envi-\\nronments. Digital nudges have been explored across various\\ncontexts, including privacy, work, and productivity. However,\\nthere is growing interest in the application of digital nudges\\nwithin social contexts, where they are designed to promote\\nmore sustainable behaviors, as well as in health-related con-\\ntext, where the objective is to guide users toward actions that\\nare more beneficial to their well-being [74]. In the latter con-\\ntext, digital nudges are highly effective, resulting in a 63%\\nreduction in the proportion of unhealthy food choices and a\\n30% increase in the selection of healthy food products [75].\\nD. DIFFERENCES & CONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS WORK\\nSeveral attempts have been made to integrate healthiness into\\nfood recommender systems, with some studies focusing on\\ngenerating healthier food options, while others emphasize\\nproviding nutritional advice tailored to the user’s goals [24],\\n[76], [77]. However, a systematic review on food recommen-\\ndation systems over the past decade revealed that less than\\n20% of the literature incorporates nutritional considerations\\nin the process of making food items recommendations [60].\\nFurthermore, findings by Trattner et al. [27] indicate that the\\nmajority of online recipes are generally unhealthy, highlight-\\ning the need for food recommendation systems to prioritize\\nthe healthiness of recommended items rather than focusing\\nsolely on algorithmic accuracy and user preference optimiza-\\ntion.\\nDigital nudging, on the other hand, is a rapidly a growing\\nfield of research that has proven to be an effective solution\\nin the area of behavioral change. The strength of these tech-\\nniques lies in their ease of implementation and evaluation.\\nIn the food domain, digital nudges have demonstrated their\\nability to guide users toward healthier food choices [78], [79].\\nGiven the potential of these technologies, several efforts have\\nbeen made to investigate the combination of recommender\\nsystems and digital nudges to promote healthier food choices.\\nThese attempts recognize the powerful role that such inte-\\ngrated approaches can support and guide individuals toward\\nbetter dietary decisions, thereby enhancing public health\\noutcomes [39].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, no prior research has sys-\\ntematically reviewed the integration of digital nudges with\\nrecommender systems specifically for promoting healthier\\nfood choices. However, the latest work of [80] has focused\\non using digital nudges and recommender systems in the\\ncontext of obesity prevention. In contrast, our work systemat-\\nically identifies and classifies digital nudging techniques for\\nfood selection. Figure (1) illustrates how digital nudges are\\nintegrated into the process of a food recommender system.\\nSpecifically, digital nudges are employed in the interface\\nand representation elements rather than in the algorithm\\ngeneration phase. This distinction highlights that the primary\\ndifferent between a recommender system and a nudge lies\\nin the design elements enhanced by digital nudges towards\\nthe desired proposes [39], [81]. Building on this foundation,\\nwe present the work that integrates these digital nudges\\nwithin food recommender systems and propose a mapping\\nframework that outlines potential combinations for facilitat-\\ning healthier food choices.\\nIII. METHODOLOGY\\nThis section outlines the search strategy for the literature\\nreview and presents the research findings based on the\\nproposed research questions. The paper follows traditional\\nguidelines for conducting a systematic literature review [82],\\n[83].\\nVOLUME 4, 2016 5',\n",

RESULTS\\nThis section begins with an overview of publication statis-\\ntics and outlets, followed by an in-depth analysis of key\\nfindings related to the integration of digital nudges into\\nfood recommender systems. Subsequently, it categorizes the\\ndigital nudging techniques investigated for promoting health-\\nier food choices, aligning them with previously validated\\nframeworks. Finally, the section provides a summary of the\\ndatasets, measurement methods, and recruited participants\\nused in the user studies, offering insights into the method-\\nologies employed for evaluating user behaviors.\\nA. PUBLICATION STATISTICS\\nA total of 3,130 primary studies were initially retrieved for\\nthis literature review, as presented in Table 1. During the\\nselection process based on the inclusion criteria outlined\\nin [90] and after duplicated removal, this number was re-\\nduced to 47 studies. In the analysis phase, 19 papers were\\nselected based on the author’s abstract and full paper text\\nreading. Most of the studies were published during 2021,\\nwhile only two contributions were published in the first part\\nof 2024. The distribution of the studies published per year\\nis illustrated in Figure 3.(A). The distribution of relevant\\npapers retrieved from various sources is depicted in Fig-\\nure 3.(B). The data reveals that the ACM Digital Library [85]\\ncontains the largest collection of research on digital nudges\\nand food recommender systems, comprising 70% of the total\\n19 papers. In contrast, 15% of these papers were published\\nin journals available through ScienceDirect [87]. The IEEE\\nXplore Digital Library [86] and PubMed [89] contribute the\\nleast to the research corpus on this topic, with each source\\nrepresenting 10% and 5% of both conference and journal\\npapers, respectively.\\nB. FOOD RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS AND DIGITAL\\nNUDGES\\nAdvancements in technology and computational power have\\nsignificantly enhanced the accuracy of personalization in\\nrecommender systems [59]. However, the multifaceted com-\\nplexity of the food domain necessitates incorporating behav-\\nioral change techniques, particularly through digital nudg-\\ning, within the representation phase of the recommendation\\nprocess [12]. This integration aims to support individuals in\\nmaking healthier food choices by employing several nudging\\ntechniques on the front-end interface.\\nTABLE 2: The integrated digital nudges and recommender\\nsystems approaches.\\nRecommendation\\napproach\\nNudging Technique Studies\\nContent-Based\\nNutritional Food Labels [65], [93], [94]\\nExplanations [11], [94]\\nPositioning [42]\\nRe-ranking [95]\\nSocial Norms [93]\\nKnowledge-Based\\nNutritional Food Labels [65], [96]\\nNotifications [97]\\nCollaborative Filtering Nutritional Food Labels [98], [96]\\nApproximately 47% of the 19 reviewed papers success-\\nfully demonstrate the integration of recommender systems\\nwith digital nudges. Content-based recommender systems\\nemerge as the most frequently integrated technique, utilized\\nin 8 studies and combined with 5 distinct digital nudges.\\nTable 2 outlines the studies that employed content-based\\napproaches for generating recommendations and applying\\nnudges. Notably, nutritional food labels were the most ex-\\ntensively examined, integrated with recommender systems\\nin 7 studies, and tested across all recommender approaches.\\nIntegrating digital nudges based on various nutritional food\\nlabels into a content-based recipe recommender system has\\nbeen shown to impact the healthiness of selected recipes\\ncompared to conditions without nudges. Specifically, using\\nMultiple Traffic Light (MTL) labeling results in a modest\\nimprovement in the healthiness of chosen recipes, as mea-\\nsured by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) score. This effect\\nis measured in both web-based recommender systems and\\nchatbot-based mobile applications [65], [94]. However, a\\nstudy indicates that when food items are annotated with a\\ncombination of nutritional and environmental labels, there\\nis a stronger tendency toward sustainability rather than\\nhealthier choices [93]. Interestingly, constructing a TF-IDF-\\nbased recipe content recommender system, combined with\\nhealth-related explanations as nudges, leads to healthier food\\nchoices when recipe recommendations are presented as a\\nsingle list rather than multiple lists [11]. Starke et al. [42] sug-\\ngest that aligning food recommendations with users’ dietary\\ngoals can overcome the positional nudge effect on user choice\\nbehavior. Conversely, another study found that integrating\\na simple re-ranking mechanism into various content-based\\nrecommenders significantly increased the selection of recipes\\nVOLUME 4, 2016 7',\n",

However, when nutritional food labels are incorporated\\nas nudges, they have been shown to effectively promote\\nhealthier food choices within both collaborative filtering and\\nknowledge-based recommender systems [96], [98]. Addi-\\ntionally, ongoing research has reported the integration of a\\nknowledge-based recommender system with another type of\\ndigital nudge, which explicitly sends notifications to users as\\nreminders to make healthy food choices in mobile applica-\\ntions [97].\\nIntegrating digital nudges into personalized content in\\nthe food domain has demonstrated significant potential for\\ndriving behavioral change. Surprisingly, this direction has\\nreceived the least attention from both academia and indus-\\ntry [12], [39], as shown in Table 2. The following section\\nreviews and categorizes the primary contributions of digital\\nnudging techniques toward promoting healthier food choices\\nand discusses the impact of each method.\\nC. DIGITAL NUDGES FOR HEALTHIER FOOD CHOICE\\nOur analysis identified 20 studies documenting the use of dig-\\nital nudges. The three most frequently employed techniques\\nwere nutritional food labels, positional nudges, and prompts,\\nwhile feedback, defaults, and menu labeling were the least\\nutilized among the 11 reported techniques. We categorize\\nthose nudging techniques into Cadario et al. digital nudging\\nfor a healthier choice framework detailed in Table 3.\\nAffective-oriented digital nudges have been identified as\\nthe most frequently employed techniques, surpassing cog-\\nnitive and behavioral-oriented nudges, with four distinct\\nmethods documented across nine studies, as shown in Ta-\\nble 3. Among these, the combination of prompt and feed-\\nback nudges has addressed two key challenges in promot-\\ning healthy eating: encouraging mindful, slower eating and\\nTABLE 3: Implemented digital nudging techniques for\\nhealthier food choices, categorized based on the framework\\nexplained in (II-C)\\nCategory Technique Studies\\nAffective\\nPrompt [99], [100] , [101]\\nFeedback [99], [100], [102]\\nExplanations [102]\\nIncentives [103]\\nCognitive\\nNutritional Food Labels [99], [104], [102], [100]\\nVisualization [105], [106]\\nBehavioral\\nPositioning [99], [100], [107]\\nSocial Norms [108], [105]\\nDefaults [107]\\nfostering healthy eating habits [101]. Incorporating game-\\nful elements into mobile applications, such as providing\\nfood explanations, has effectively enhanced users’ nutritional\\nknowledge and encouraged healthier food choices [102].\\nAlternatively, by designing rewards and incentives, users are\\nfurther motivated to adopt healthy diets that can help prevent\\nthe spread of non-communicable diseases. This approach\\nillustrates how a combination of explicit and implicit inter-\\nventions can promote healthy behaviors in offline settings\\n(i.e., groceries) through digital means [103].\\nNutritional food labels are the most prevalent cognitive\\ndigital-oriented food nudges, typically presented in the form\\nof Multiple Traffic Light systems [99], [102], [104]. These\\nlabels have proven highly effective, leading to an average\\n59% increase in healthy and sustainable food choices [104].\\nInterstenly, a visualization cue as a food nudge linked to a\\nself-report mobile application has proven to lead to effec-\\ntiveness in user self-tracking their eating behaviors and the\\n8 VOLUME 4, 2016',\n",

Despite this growing inter-\\nest, the long-term effects of digital nudges still need to be ex-\\nplored in the literature. However, one study has demonstrated\\na notable long-term impact, revealing that using multiple\\nfood nudges in a digital environment significantly improved\\nthe nutritional quality of food choices in an online canteen\\nsetting over a 15-month period [100].\\nD. DATASETS, MEASUREMENT, AND PARTICIPANT\\nFood recommender system studies focus on both online and\\noffline evaluations. Offline evaluation helps identify the best\\nalgorithms based on recommendation accuracy and requires\\na source dataset for experimentation [111]. To accurately as-\\nsess the system’s impact, selecting appropriate measurement\\nmetrics and involving suitable participants in the experiments\\nis essential [112]. A comprehensive evaluation of a food\\nrecommender system must ensure both holistic assessment\\nand research reproducibility. Therefore, we evaluate and ex-\\ntract the data source, measurement metrics, and number of\\nparticipants from each eligible study [12], [113].\\nAmong the 19 studies reviewed, Only six disclosed their\\ndata sources for conducting user experiments and analyses.\\nThe Allrecipes.com dataset was notably the most frequently\\nutilized in five studies [42], [65], [94]–[96], [98]. A combina-\\ntion of various data sources was reported as the basis for one\\nexperiment [97]. The remaining studies opted to keep their\\ndatasets private, offering exploration only upon request.\\nThere is a lack of precise details regarding the evaluation\\nmetrics for recommendation algorithm performance in the\\nreviewed studies. Only one study provides concrete details on\\nselecting the most accurate recommendation algorithms [98].\\nWhile other research suggests using state-of-the-art recom-\\nmenders or widely adopted approaches appropriate for the\\ncontext. Concerning health metrics, seven studies reported\\nusing international healthiness scores, such as the FSA score,\\nNutri-Score, or Eco-Score, to assess the healthiness of the\\ndatasets utilized and collected [11], [65], [93]–[96], [98].\\nAmong the studies reviewed, all provided comprehensive\\ndetails on the number of participants and the specific user\\ngroups involved. The exception was a study that failed to\\ninclude such information [101]. Additionally, another study\\nsuggested conducting a user experiment as future work\\nbut did not specify the number or type of users to be\\ninvolved [97]. Of the studies that did specify participant\\ndemographics, few focused on high school and university\\nstudents [99], [102], whereas the remaining studies encom-\\npassed a range of diverse or general population groups. The\\nsample sizes across these studies varied significantly, ranging\\nfrom a minimum of 5 participants to a maximum of 1331,\\nwith a mean of 398.19 and a standard deviation of 425.60\\nparticipants.\\nV. FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES\\nThis section critically examines the gaps identified in current\\nresearch regarding integrating food recommender systems\\nand digital nudges to promote healthier food choices. The\\nanalysis is grounded in the reviewed state-of-the-art litera-\\nture. Subsequently, we highlight emerging opportunities by\\nanalyzing the various dimensions of the reviewed studies\\nalongside examples from other domains.\\nN u t r i t i o n a l  F o o d   l a b e l s\\nE x p l a n a t i o n s\\nC o n t e n t - b a s e d\\nC o l l a b o r a t i v e -\\nf i l t e r i n g\\nK n o w l e d g e -\\nb a s e d\\nP o s i t i o n i n g\\nR e - r a n k i n g\\nD i g i t a l  n u d g i n g  t e c h n i q u e s\\nR e c o m m e n d e r  s y s t e m s R e c o m m e n d e r  s y s t e m s  w i t h  d i g i t a l  \\nn u d g i n g  \\nS o c i a l  N o r m s\\nN o t i f i c a t i o n\\nP r o m p t\\nI n c e n t i v e s\\nV i s u a l i z a t i o n\\nD e f a u l t s\\nF e e d b a c k\\nFIGURE 4: Explored digital nudging techniques for healthy\\nfood choices. The intersection highlights those implemented\\nwithin food recommender systems.\\nExisting literature highlights the integration of vari-\\nous recommendation approaches with digital nudging tech-\\nniques [39]. This study further indicates that several efforts\\nhave been made to incorporate such interventions into food\\nrecommender systems. Nudging, which involves shaping the\\ndesign of choice architecture, should therefore be embed-\\nded in the presentation phase of the food recommendation\\nprocess, irrespective of the recommendation algorithms or\\napproaches applied [32], [35], [114], [115]. Out of the eleven\\nnudging techniques we have identified, six techniques have\\nalready been tested in a recommender system context. In\\ncontrast, five of them have not yet been implemented in a\\nrecommender context. Furthermore, there are various combi-\\nnations of multiple techniques and approaches that warrant\\nfurther investigation [39]. Figure 4 offers a comprehensive\\noverview of both the explored and unexplored digital nudging\\ntechniques within food recommender systems for healthy\\nfood choices.\\nImplementing digital nudges for behavioral change within\\nrecommender systems involves several key steps to ensure\\nsuccessful application and evaluation [115], [116]. The first\\nVOLUME 4, 2016 9',\n",
       " 'EL Majjodiet al.: Integrating Digital Food Nudges and Recommender Systems: Current Status and Future Directions\\nstep is to define the context and objectives of the nudge,\\nwith the aim of supporting users in making healthier food\\nchoices through the recommender interface. This is followed\\nby a comprehensive diagnosis to understand the decision-\\nmaking process, how user preferences are elicited, and the\\ntechniques used for generating and presenting recommen-\\ndations [35], [115], [117]. Selecting appropriate nudges re-\\nquires a thorough understanding of the recommendation\\nprocess, including the types of interfaces users will interact\\nwith, the characteristics of the target audience, and the ex-\\ntent to which nudging strategies should be integrated [11],\\n[65]. The final phase involves evaluating the impact of these\\nnudges on user behavior. However, the evaluation should\\ngo beyond measuring behavioral changes, incorporating an\\nanalysis of the overall user experience and considering the\\nsystem’s complexity and other factors that may influence\\nfood choices [12]. A holistic approach to evaluation will help\\nensure that nudging strategies not only encourage healthier\\nbehaviors but also enhance the usability and effectiveness of\\nthe recommender system [112].\\nExtensive research on designing recommender systems has\\nmade selecting approaches for generating recommendations\\neasier in recent years [9], [12]. While, choosing suitable\\nnudging techniques to integrate into the recommendation\\nprocess remains complex. This review identifies five nudg-\\ning interventions that have not yet been employed in food\\nrecommender systems for healthy food choices. However,\\nwe believe that only those outlined below are worth further\\ninvestigation [39]:\\n• Default: A nudge technique found the most prominent\\nwithin nudging and behavioral change literature [115],\\n[118]. It consists of a pre-selection of a given choice.\\nWithin recommender systems, it has proven to be the\\nmost studied technique across various fields [116]. To\\npromote healthy choices within the food recommender\\nsystem, setting the defaults involves pre-selecting the\\nhealthiest options from the generated food recommen-\\ndations for a given use based on the health metric\\nused to evaluate the recipes. Several studies have ex-\\nplored the impact of default settings on user behavior\\nwithin recommender systems [119]. Starting with a\\ndefault option often leads users to select it or a similar\\nchoice, while also shaping user preferences, which has\\nthe potential to encourage healthier behaviors [116],\\n[120]. For example, one study found that users were\\nsatisfied when the most sustainable and environmentally\\nfriendly trip routes with lower CO2 emissions were set\\nas the default in a route recommender system [121]. In\\nthe food domain, nudging users toward healthier food\\nchoices through default settings is worth the exploration\\nregarding the potential of this technique to influence\\nuser behaviors in other domains [122].\\n• Visualization: Interventions that increase the salience of\\nitems, such as enhancing image quality or emphasiz-\\ning text, are designed to capture users’ attention [39],\\n[123]. In food recommender systems, visual enhance-\\nments—such as high-quality images, highlighting the\\nnutritional attributes, or creating graphics for health-\\nier options—can support more informed and health-\\nconscious decision-making in addition to increasing\\nuser satisfaction [42], [124]. For example, visual cues\\nhave successfully encouraged sustainable fashion con-\\nsumption by drawing attention to second-hand garments\\nand providing sustainability information [125]. Simi-\\nlarly, in book recommendations, nudging users toward\\noff-profile content has increased the selection of books\\nbeyond their preferred genres [126].\\n• Prompt: A prompt is defined as a strategically deliv-\\nered message or reminder aimed at users in specific\\ncontexts to influence behavior [127]. It is frequently\\nemployed to address situations where individuals are\\nprone to engage in undesirable or unhealthy behaviors,\\nproviding timely guidance toward healthier alternatives.\\nThe use of prompts has been shown to facilitate effective\\nbehavioral change across various domains, including\\ntransportation, healthcare, environmental conservation,\\nand education, both in online and offline settings [128]–\\n[130]. The integration of prompts within recommender\\nsystems has not been extensively explored in the lit-\\nerature [39]. Nevertheless, incorporating reminders to\\nencourage healthier food choices within these systems\\ncan be approached in various ways, such as prompting\\nusers to consider more nutritious alternatives during\\ndecision-making processes. In conversational recom-\\nmender systems, prompts can further enhance the user\\nexperience by facilitating reflection on their choices\\nthrough explanations and cues [131], thereby supporting\\nmore informed and health-conscious decision-making.\\nFeedback interventions are used as nudging strategies in\\nareas like education and nutrition [80], [132] to provide in-\\nformation about past behaviors to guide future actions [133].\\nHowever, integrating them into recommender systems is\\nchallenging due to the complexity and risk of increasing\\ncognitive load. Research shows that feedback can sometimes\\nhave negative effects [134], [135], while incentives, often\\napplied after a decision, may offer only short-term behavior\\nchanges, especially monetary ones. Furthermore, incentives\\ncan undermine intrinsic motivation, making it harder to sus-\\ntain desired behaviors [136], [137]. Implementing such in-\\nterventions in personalized food recommender systems adds\\ncomplexities that may overwhelm users [138].\\nDigital nudges are strategically designed to influence user\\ninteractions with the interface and ought to be integrated\\nduring the final phase of the recommendation process (i.e.,\\nFigure 1 Part (C): representation).\\nThe current study elucidates several areas requiring fur-\\nther exploration. Foremost among these is the insufficient\\nevaluation of used datasets and their quality in compliance\\nwith established international health standards [139]. This\\ngap in the assessment process undermines the reliability va-\\nlidity, and reproducibility of the proposed research. Addition-\\n10 VOLUME 4, 2016',\n",

As demonstrated\\nin [112], [140], incorporating user evaluations remains the\\nmost robust method for accurately assessing the performance\\nand effectiveness of recommender systems. Addressing these\\nissues in future research is essential for advancing the field\\nand improving the practical utility of food recommmender\\nsystems integrated with digital nudges for healthier choices.\\nAnother crucial area for further research is the long-\\nterm impact of nudging techniques on users’ lifestyles and\\nbehavior [116], [141]. We are confident that these tech-\\nniques contribute to a deeper understanding of user decision-\\nmaking, ultimately fostering awareness and supporting in-\\nformed choices. Additionally, they have been shown to in-\\nduce positive habit changes, a benefit well-documented in\\noffline settings [142], [143].\\nFurthermore, integrating nudging techniques into recom-\\nmender systems can enhance their effectiveness by promot-\\ning diverse and healthier recommendations.

At the same time,\\nthis poses a serious decision-making challenge due to the abundance\\nof food-related content on recipe websites, such as food images,\\ncategories, and cooking videos. Recommender systems can help\\nusers to filter that information, narrowing down the options to\\nchoose from based on user preferences or needs to present the most\\nrelevant content [21].\\nResearch on food recommender systems has shown how to facil-\\nitate people’s food decision-making [24, 57]. Based on bookmarks\\nand ratings given to recipes by users, such recommenders retrieve\\nrecipes that contain, for example, the same ingredients as recipes\\nliked previously. Because such recommender tend to push pop-\\nular content, their success backfires in the sense that the often\\nrecommended, popular content tends to be unhealthy [55], thereby\\nnegatively contributing to societal health problems, such as obesity\\nand diabetes.\\nIndustrial practitioners and researchers have suggested solu-\\ntions to mitigate the unhealthiness of such food recommenders.\\nAmong them, health-aware recommender systems examine how\\nhealth-related outcomes could be modelled [16, 28]. Moreover, food\\nrecommender approaches that do not optimize for user preferences\\nbut for nutritional needs have also emerged [2, 4, 43]. However, rec-\\nommender approaches that forgo on a user’s past food preferences\\ntend to lead to lower levels of user satisfaction [36], as a health or\\nnutrition-focused approach is at odds with the propensity to like\\n‘common’, popular foods [57].\\nWhat content is suggested (i.e., based on what user model, algo-\\nrithm) is only one aspect of a recommender system. The interface,\\nspecifically how the content is presented, is arguably an opportu-\\nnity to also steer user choices towards healthier options [ 35]. In\\nthis sense, nudging has shown to be an effective technique to affect\\nuser choices and to lead to behavioral change in the food domain\\n[6, 51]. Food-related nudges have been offered to consumers in\\nvarious offline contexts, such as supermarkets and cafeteria [51], in\\nan attempt to predictably affect user choices without mitigating the\\nfreedom of choice. These nudges affect ‘daily’, rather unconscious\\ndecisions that rely on heuristic cognitive processes [ 26]. Indeed,\\nhealth-related nudges could serve as a mental shortcut to users who\\ndo not wish to put effort and time into their food choices [6, 46]. A\\nmeta-review of more than 60 studies on nudging interventions for\\nhealthy food choices shows that 80% of nudging interventions (e.g.,\\n48',\n",
       " 'UMAP ’22, July 4–7, 2022, Barcelona, Spain El Majjodi, Starke and Trattner\\nthrough product placement at eye sight, use of defaults, priming)\\nleads to a 15% average increase in healthy nutritional choices [32].\\nThe use of nudges in online contexts, often referred to as ‘digital\\nnudges’, has only emerged in the past years [ 23]. Although digi-\\ntal nudges have already been applied to internet-sourced recipes\\n[3, 49], their effectiveness has only been studied in non-personalized\\ncontexts, outside the recommender context. We argue that the ef-\\nfectiveness of nudges observed in one-size-fits-all contexts, such as\\nin a brick-and-mortar supermarket, may not hold up once the con-\\ntent already fits a user’s preferences. The effectiveness of nudges\\nshould be regarded as a means to bridge the attitude-behavior gap\\n[27], which usually does not apply to contexts where the presented\\ncontent already fits the user’s attitude (i.e., as a proxy for her pref-\\nerences).\\nMoreover, a nudging intervention is not as ‘invasive’ as changing\\nthe content in a recommender system [23, 25]. By adding a health-\\nbased nudge to a constant set of recommended item, it could be\\npossible to steer user preferences towards healthier options without\\nreducing the user’s level of satisfaction, which is expected to occur\\nwhen recommended on nutritional content only [57].\\nIn a first scientific attempt to bridge the gap between health-\\niness and what people like (i.e., user satisfaction), we introduce\\ndigital nudges to a recipe recommender system. To emphasize the\\nhealth content of recipes, we introduce a cognitively oriented, in-\\nformational nudge [6, 49] in the form of nutrition labels that are\\nused on the front of food packaging (e.g., Nutri-score). Cognitively\\noriented nudges mainly motivate people to make better-informed\\ndecisions based on what they know effortlessly [6], by making spe-\\ncific information more salient [60]. In our case, this may particularly\\nhelp people who lack nutritional knowledge regarding the foods\\nor recipes they are considering to choose [61]. The choice to do so\\nin this paper is motivated by making healthy foods ‘stand out’, as\\nmany food decisions are made without much cognitive effort (cf.\\n[26]), using nutritional labels such as “Multiple Traffic Light” and\\n“Nutri-score. ” [18].\\nWe are among the first to use digital nudges in the context of food\\n[24, 48, 60], as well as among the first to apply such front-of-package\\nlabels to recipes. In an online user study, we test the effectiveness of\\ntwo different nutrition label across both non-personalized and per-\\nsonalized recommender interfaces. In addition, we examine whether\\nthis also depends on whether a user is interested in cooking healthy\\nrecipes, by inquiring on self-reported dietary goals. We address the\\nfollowing research questions:\\n•RQ1: To what extent do nutrition labels steer users\\nto healthy recipe choices across personalized and non-\\npersonalized food recommender systems?\\n•RQ2: To what extent do personalization and nutrition labels\\naffect user choice satisfaction and difficulty?\\n•RQ3: To what extent do user-based and evaluative factors\\npredict the healthiness of a chosen recipe?\\nThis paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the related\\nwork to our research, while our methodology is presented in Sec-\\ntion 3, where we report the results of the offline recommender\\nevaluation of our recipe dataset, as well as the research design of\\nour online evaluation. Section 4 presents the results of our statis-\\ntical analyses, of which the implications are further discussed in\\nSection 5.\\n2 RELATED WORK\\nDigital technology can play an important role in supporting health-\\nier food choices. However, the current approaches may be biased\\ntowards short-term user preferences [12, 29], rather longer-term\\ngoals [44]. We discuss how digital nudges, specifically nutrition\\nlabels, can support healthier food choices across personalized and\\nnon-personalized recommender interfaces.\\n2.1 Recommender Systems\\nRecommender systems retrieve and present content to users based\\non what they liked in current or previous sessions [22]. Whereas\\nmuch work has been conducted in leisure and e-commerce domains,\\nsuch as movies and books [40], the number of studies performed\\non food recommender systems have only increased in the past\\ndecade [57]. To make sense of contemporary food recommender\\nsystems, it is argued that there are three dominant types of ap-\\nproaches, in terms of what type of data or goals are used for per-\\nsonalization [36, 46].\\nThe most traditional approach for food recommenders is to opti-\\nmize their algorithms based on a user’s eating preferences only [14].\\nThis could come in the form of ratings and bookmarks on recipe\\nwebsites [14], or through past purchases in an online supermar-\\nket environment [64]. For the recipe domain, most models assume\\nthat users like to receive recipe suggestions containing ingredi-\\nents that they liked in the past [14, 20], or recipes from the same\\ncategory [45, 58], typically exploiting Collaborative Filtering and\\nContent-Based methods [57].\\nThe two other types of food recommenders either only focus\\non the nutritional needs of the user [ 36], or aim to balance user\\npreferences and nutritional needs [4, 46, 52, 57]. This can be incor-\\nporated in the form of constraints for specific nutrients in recipe\\nretrieval [37, 53], or by suggesting foods to eat or buy based on\\nmissing nutrient or a user’s health status [33, 59]. Agapito et al. [2]\\npresent a knowledge-based nutritional recommender system based\\non the user’s health condition, using a profiler to process user in-\\nformation and matching that to a database of nutritional advice.\\nWhereas nutrition-based recommenders can lead to comparatively\\nlower levels of user satisfaction [ 57], other approaches apply a\\nhybrid recommender approach. To balance both health and user\\npreferences, a few approaches have adopted a hybrid approach in\\nwhich similar recipes are retrieved and re-ranked based on a specific\\nhealth-related feature [45, 55]. Beyond the food domain, health has\\nalso been the focal point of investigation [43], such as to promote\\nphysical activity or to suggest medical adherence behaviors.\\n2.2 Digital Nudges\\nMost food recommender studies do not investigate beyond changes\\nin the recommended content [23, 44, 49]. Nudges can support users\\nto make healthier food choices [51], for example by making them\\nmore aware of a recipe’s nutritional content [3], without changing\\nthe presented content. Although food-related nudges have been\\nsuccessfully applied to offline contexts [6], such as by re-arranging\\n49',\n",
       " 'Nudging Towards Health? UMAP ’22, July 4–7, 2022, Barcelona, Spain\\na supermarket shelf to display healthy products at eye level, much\\nless is known about the effectiveness in digital contexts [49].\\nAn important difference between, say, a brick-and-mortar su-\\npermarket and a recipe website with a food recommender system\\nis the level of personalization. Although nudges are effective in a\\nphysical supermarket [6], it remains an open question whether they\\nare effective if the context is already personalized towards what a\\nuser likes? And, as a problem that is specific to this paper, would\\nthey still support healthier recipe choices amidst a personalized list\\nof recipe recommendations?\\nDifferent types of nudges could be used to address these ques-\\ntions. Cadario et al. [ 6] discern between three types of healthy\\neating nudges: cognitively oriented nudges (e.g., through informa-\\ntional visibility or cues), affectively oriented nudges (e.g., through\\nattractiveness food images [49]), and behaviorally oriented nudges\\n(e.g., re-ranking lists of recommendations on health [3, 49]). The\\nfocal point of this paper is the use of informational nudges, as such\\ncould also be easily applied beyond the food domain. For example,\\nemphasizing specific information on an e-commerce website might\\nalso ‘nudge’ users towards different purchases (cf. [23]). Moreover,\\nbehaviorally oriented digital nudges are less interesting to examine\\nin this context, as some are commonly applied in recommender\\nsystems: the most relevant items are typically presented first [40].\\n2.3 Nutrition Labels\\nThe health-based cognitively oriented or informational nudge ex-\\namined in this paper is the addition of a nutrition label. Our work\\nis based on Front-of-Package (FoP) labels [11, 61], found on indi-\\nvidual products in supermarkets. MRI studies have revealed that\\nthe addition of a food label that either emphasizes the healthiness\\n(e.g., high in calories, low in fat) or taste (e.g., sweet and juicy) of\\na food item, leads to varying brain activity [17], which could thus\\nfacilitate a shift towards healthier food choices.\\nRecently, more research has emphasized the importance of nu-\\ntritional food labels to support people in meeting dietary intake\\nlevels [50]. Several guidelines have been found in the literature\\nfor designing food labels, such as capturing consumers’ attention,\\nas well the ease with which consumers can process, evaluate, and\\ninfluence the decision-making [19, 38]. Accordingly, in several stud-\\nies, Multiple Traffic Light (MTL) and Nutri-score nutrition labels\\nhave been found to lead to an increase in healthy food choices,\\ncompared to other types of food labels [10, 35, 41].\\n2.4 Contribution\\nOur work examines to what extent we support users in making\\nfood decisions online, while not mitigating their experience with\\nusing a personalized recommender system. The reviewed related\\nwork shows that we are among the first to combine personalization\\nand nudging (cf. [47]), particularly in the food domain. In doing so,\\nwe propose a novel application of behavioral economics strategies\\nwithin a recommender system, with the following contributions:\\n•Applying nutrition labels to recipes to examine whether they\\ncan support healthy food choices.\\n•Comparing the effectiveness of nudges across personalized\\nand randomized advice interfaces in the recipe retrieval do-\\nmain, combining content based on user preferences with\\ncontext based on health needs.\\n3 METHODOLOGY\\nThe following sections describe the proposed methodology for our\\noffline and online evaluations. We first describe the dataset used,\\nafter which we determine which algorithm attains the highest ac-\\ncuracy level. The setup of our recommender interface, the followed\\nprocedure and research design, and the used measures are explained\\nthereafter.\\n3.1 Dataset\\nWe consulted a recipe database from the website Allrecipes.com,\\nwhich was used in previous recommender studies [45, 58]. It initially\\ncontained over 58263 recipes, which were arranged into several\\nfood categories. For our studies, we narrowed down the dataset to\\nfour food categories (cf. Table 1), from which we randomly sampled\\na dataset of 991 recipes. The dataset included basic and nutritional\\nrecipe metadata: URL image, number of calories, servings and serv-\\ning size, and saturated fat, sodium, protein, fat, and salt . The mean\\nrating given to the recipes was rather high: 4.45 on a 5-point scale\\n(SD=0.04).\\nTable 1: Allrecipes.com dataset used for algorithm training\\nand the user study.\\nRecipe Category Number of Recipes\\nMeat and Poultry 444\\nFruit and Vegetables 339\\nBarbecue 123\\nPasta, Noodles and Seafood 85\\n3.2 Offline Evaluation\\nTo determine which recommender algorithm could best predict\\nuser preferences, we performed offline evaluation on our dataset.\\nIn doing so, we focused on the highest level of accuracy based on\\nthe prediction error, through the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)\\nand the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The data was evaluated using\\nfive-fold cross-validation, as was common in other recommender\\nstudies [14, 56].\\nTable 2 reports the results. It was apparent that Singular Value\\nDecomposition (SVD) [15] outperformed other the other algorithms\\nthat were included (e.g., SVD++, NMF, KNNWithMeans), in terms\\nof the prediction error measured. Hence, SVD was integrated into\\nour recommender interface for our online evaluation, to match\\nthe presented recipes to elicited user preferences. This would be\\ncompared against a random recommendation scenario, based on a\\nrandom generator function described in [34].\\n3.3 System Design and Procedure\\nWe developed an interactive recommender system that gener-\\nated recipe recommendations. All users were asked to fill out a\\n50',\n",

Subsequently, they were asked to select one out\\nof four preferred food categories, from which they would receive\\nrecommendations.\\nTo elicit user preferences, all users were asked to provide prefer-\\nence ratings to a list of ten recipes from the preferred food category.\\nHalf of the presented recipes were designated as healthy, based\\non an FSA health metric (cf. Subsection 3.6.1), while the other half\\nwere designated as unhealthy. Afterwards, all users were presented\\na list of ten recipes, which was either personalized on the given\\nratings or not (cf. Subsection 3.4), and again discerned between\\nfive healthy and five unhealthy recipes. Each recipe depicted its\\ncalories, the number of servings, the serving size in grams, the title\\nof the recipe, and a photo; see Figure 1. Depending on the research\\ndesign, a nutrition label (i.e., Nutri-Score or Multiple Traffic Light)\\nwas shown or not.\\nEach user was asked to choose one recipe they would like to cook\\nat home.

In the personalized scenario, we used the given\\nratings to generate a list of ten personalized recipes using an SVD\\nrecommendation method. In contrast, the non-personalized sce-\\nnario generated a list of random recipes from the preferred food\\ncategory. Within each recommendation scenario, the baseline group\\nwas presented ten recipes without any labeling annotation, while\\nthe other two treatment groups interacted with recipes that were\\nannotated with either MTL or Nutri-score labels. This variation\\nin label annotation is also depicted in Figure 1. Accordingly, the\\nparticipant was randomly assigned to any of the six conditions.\\n3.5 Study Participants\\nWe recruited 600 Amazon MTurk workers to participate in our\\nonline study. The recruitment was based on a high level of hits (>\\n500 hits) and each participant was compensated with 1 USD for the\\ntask that approximately required 10min. Overall, participants (42%\\nfemale) in this experiment were on average 39.53 years old, and\\nhad almost all attained their high school diploma.\\n3.6 Measures\\n3.6.1 Recipe healthiness. The healthiness of recipes could be as-\\nsessed using various metrics (e.g., WHO, HCTS [ 7, 39]). In our\\nstudy, we adopted the most commonly validated measure for food\\nhealthiness, the FSA score, which was issued by the British Food\\nStandards Agency [9].\\nThe FSA score was composed of four different nutrients: fat, sat-\\nurates, sugar, and sodium. For each nutrient, it discerned between\\nlow, medium, or high content within a recipe. One point is assigned\\nfor each level (low, medium, high) per nutrient, leading to a scored\\nscale that ran from 4 (healthiest) to 12 (least healthy). For example,\\nfat content was designated as low if it fell below 3g per 100g served,\\nwhile a medium range for saturated fat fell between 3g/100g and\\n17g/100g served. High recipe content not only considered the per\\n100g content, but also the total weight in g per serving. All compu-\\ntational details about the FSA score were reported in Starke et al.\\n[49]. Table 3 presents the FSA score distribution of recipes found\\nin our dataset.\\nWe discerned between healthy and unhealthy recipes based on\\nthe FSA score. Recipes were considered healthy if their FSA score\\nfell between 4 to 8, while ‘less healthy’ recipes had an FSA score\\nbetween 9 and 12.\\nTable 3: The FSA scores for recipes used in our study.\\nFSA score 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\\nNumber of recipes 4 43 102 150 158 199 295 24 16\\n3.6.2 Nutrition Labels.

Accordingly, each recipe nutrient\\nwas represented by a color that indicated whether the amount\\nfound in the recipe was considered low (green), medium (amber), or\\n51',\n",

On the other hand, the Nutri-score labeling system [8]\\nsignalled recipe healthiness through a color-coded summary evalu-\\nation, ranging from dark green -A- (healthiest) to dark red -E- (least\\nhealthy), which was based on energy, nutrients, and ingredients.\\nTable 4 presents the Nutri-score of the recipes found in our study.\\nTable 4: The Nutri-scores for recipes used in our study.

For a user’s evaluation, we assessed their\\nexperienced choice difficulty and choice satisfaction. Each metric\\nwas measured using pre-validated questionnaire items [ 49, 62],\\nwhich are outlined in Table 5. All responses to our propositions\\nwere recorded on 5-point Likert scales. Two questionnaire items\\nhad to removed, for they negatively affected the respective values\\nof Cronbach’s Alpha, making it uncertain whether they measured\\nthe same construct. The remaining four items resulted in acceptable\\nto good levels of reliability.\\n3.6.4 User Characteristics. As mentioned in Subsection 3.3, we also\\ninquired on a number of user characteristics and goals, which were\\nused to address RQ3. Besides basic demographics that were added\\nto the model as continuous variables (i.e., gender, level of education,\\nage), we also inquired on a user’s self-reported level of cooking\\nexperience and healthiness of eating habits (both on 5-point scales).\\nMoreover, we asked users to disclose any eating goals they would\\nhave, such as eating less sugar or more protein. For our analysis,\\nwe included the number of self-reported healthy eating goals a\\ncontinuous variable in our model (M=1.79, SD=1.53).\\n4 RESULTS\\nWe analyzed the healthiness of chosen recipes across different\\nrecommendation approaches and label annotations (RQ1), as well\\nas the choice satisfaction and choice difficulty reported by our\\nsystem users using two-way ANOVAs (RQ2). Finally, we predicted\\nthe healthiness of chosen recipes using different types of factors in\\na regression model (RQ3).\\n4.1 RQ1: Healthiness of Chosen Recipes\\nWe examined the FSA score of chosen recipes across all condi-\\ntions. Figure 2 depicts the choice distribution in terms of whether\\nrecipes were designated as healthy (FSA < 9) or unhealthy (FSA >\\n8). We found that 65% of chosen recipes were healthy in the non-\\npersonalized scenario (random recommender algorithm), while 60%\\nof recipes chosen in the personalized scenario were unhealthy.\\nWhether any of the observed differences were statistically sig-\\nnificant was examined using a two way between-subjects ANOVA.\\nWe predicted the FSA score of the chosen recipe using the em-\\nployed recommendation approach (control: Random algorithm ,\\ntreatment:SVD) and the employed front-of-pack nutrition labels\\n(control: no-label, treatments: Nutri-score, MTL). Table 6 indicates\\nthat whether recommendations were personalized significantly af-\\nfected the healthiness of chosen recipes: F(1,594) = 12.91, p < 0.01.\\nNo label Nutri MTL\\nRandom SVD Random SVD Random SVD\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\nRecommendation approche\\nCount\\nhealthiness\\nhealthy\\nunhealthy\\nRecommendation approach\\nHealthinessHealthyLess healthy\\nCount\\nNo labelNutri-scoreMTL\\nFigure 2: Distribution of healthy and less healthy recipe\\nchoices across our different recommender and labelling con-\\nditions.\\nConcerning the nutrition labels, Table 6 indicates there were no\\nsignificant differences between any of the two labelled conditions\\nand the no-label baseline (both p-values > 0.05). Moreover, we nei-\\nther observed any interaction effects between the recommendation\\napproach and the used labels (both p-values > 0.05). Figure 2 sug-\\ngests that the use of nutrition labels (both Nutri-score and MTL)\\nled to slightly more healthy recipe choices in the non-personalized\\ncondition (compared to No Label), while the number of healthy\\nchoices made in the personalized condition was actually lower for\\nboth of the labelled conditions (again compared to No Label). How-\\never, as indicated by our ANOVA results, this interaction effect was\\nnot significant.\\nWe checked for additional differences using a post-hoc Tukey\\nHSD test. This confirmed that the mean FSA score of recipes cho-\\nsen in the no-personalization approach (M=7.87, SD=1.86) was sig-\\nnificantly lower than those chosen in the personalized condition\\n(M=8.35, SD=1.54). The Tukey test did not reveal any additional\\ndifferences. Taken together, these results suggested that a high level\\nof personalization of recipes led users to make unhealthier recipe\\nchoices, while nutrition labels did not seem to mitigate this effect\\nand had only a small, non-significant effect in the non-personalized\\ncondition.\\n4.2 RQ2: User Evaluation\\nWe examined the user experience across all recommender system\\nconditions. We used two different two-way ANOVAs to predict\\ndifferences in choice satisfaction and choice difficulty levels.\\nThe results for choice difficulty are described in Table 7. We\\nfound a main effect of personalized on choice difficulty, indicating\\nthat personalized interfaces led to a lower perceived choice diffi-\\nculty (M = 3.38, SD = 0.15) compared to our non-personalized\\nrecommenders (M = 3.41, SD = 0.05): F(1,594) = 10.04, p = 0.002.\\nAlthough the addition of nutrition labels did not significantly af-\\nfect choice difficulty as a main effect (both MTL and Nutri-score:\\np>0.05), we did observe two interaction effects with whether the\\ncontent was personalized or not.

In contrast, users\\nwith many healthy goals seemed to particularly choose healthy\\nrecipes if they perceived little choice difficulty.\\n5 DISCUSSION\\nThe effectiveness of digital nudges within recommender systems\\nhas received attention to date [23]. In the food domain, however,\\nseveral studies stressed the potential of nudging strategies to ad-\\nvance public health in offline contexts [6]. In an attempt to bridge\\nbrick-and-mortar supermarkets and recipe websites, we have filled\\nthis research gap by applying an informational, cognitively oriented\\nnudge in a recommender system through nutrition labels.\\nOur results particularly contribute to the overall understand-\\ning of the effectiveness of personalization and nudges in the food\\ndomain. In line with the literature that describes how popular\\nrecipes in food recommender systems lead to unhealthy outcomes\\n[55, 56], we have found that personalized rather than random recipe\\nrecommendations lead to a decrease in the healthiness of chosen\\nrecipes. This confirms that the commonly used, preference-based\\nand popularity-driven approach in recommender research [ 13],\\nleads to unhealthy outcomes in recipe recommendation.\\nArguably surprisingly, we have found that this effect is not mod-\\nerated by the use of our informational nudges, the two front-of-\\npackage nutrition labels. The latter can be contextualized in terms\\nof previous food recommender system research. Recommender ap-\\nproaches are typically assessed in terms of their focus on either user\\npreferences, nutritional needs, or a trade-off between both [36, 46].\\nIn the current study, it seems that unhealthy user preferences have\\nprevailed over any health-related needs. This is arguably exacer-\\nbated by the limitations of the dataset sample used for our offline\\nand online evaluations, which contained rather popular recipes\\n(i.e., a mean preference rating of 4.5 out of 5), even more than so\\nthan related datasets used in previous studies [55, 56]. Therefore,\\nin future studies, we opt to use a more diverse dataset in terms of\\npopular and non-popular recipes, to examine this problem using a\\nmore representative sample of food-related products. Alternatively,\\neven though content-based recommender approaches may not yield\\nhigher accuracy levels than collaborative approaches [14, 57], such\\nas the SVD employed in the current study, content-based recom-\\nmendation might be able to mitigate the popularity bias in recipe\\nrecommenders (cf. [1]).\\nThis study has applied a single nudging technique to a personal-\\nized recommendation scenario. Although front-of-package labels,\\nsuch as the Nutri-score and the Multiple Traffic Light (MTL) label,\\nhave increased healthy food purchases in brick-and-mortar super-\\nmarkets [6], their effectiveness for online recipes is less profound.\\nRecent research has suggested that digital nudges might need to be\\ncombined to increase their effectiveness [23], although this applied\\nmostly to a non-personalized food retrieval system.\\nThe findings on choice difficulty are also important for stud-\\nies beyond the food domain. Although choice difficulty seems to\\nincrease due to the use of personalization (i.e., using SVD over ran-\\ndom recommendation), this effect is reversed by the introduction of\\nnutrition labels. This suggests that whereas nutrition labels are not\\nhelpful in a random recommendation context, their merit is higher\\nwhen the content is more alike, which is likely in a personalized\\n54',\n",
       " 'UMAP ’22, July 4–7, 2022, Barcelona, Spain El Majjodi, Starke and Trattner\\nscenario [5]. Our study has, thus, shown that although they may\\nnot overcome the popularity bias in recipe recommendation, they\\nmay facilitate better decision-making.\\nContrary to recommender studies in other domains [30, 63], we\\nhave not observed a significant increase in choice satisfaction for\\nthe SVD recommender compared to the random approach. The\\ndescriptive results, as indicated by Figures 2 and 4, suggest that\\nchoice satisfaction may be related to the unhealthiness of chosen\\nrecipes. Or, in other words, that there may be a positive relation\\nbetween the FSA score and choice satisfaction, which would further\\nconfirm that users appreciate popular recommender content. At the\\nsame time, this poses additional challenges for food recommender\\nstudies, which may need to sacrifice accuracy to facilitate healthy\\noutcomes [46].\\nThe results from RQ1-2 open up new research directions. For\\nexample, it is interesting to examine what are other nudging tech-\\nniques, beyond nutrition labels and other informational nudges, are\\nmore effective in supporting healthy choices, when integrated with\\na personalization recommender. In line with the rationale of this\\nstudy and previous studies [24, 49], such an approach should not\\ncome at the cost of evaluative outcomes, like choice satisfaction.\\nMoreover, it might also be interesting to examine to what extent\\nsuch nudging techniques can support changes in a user’s longer-\\nterm eating habits and diet, for previous studies have suggested\\nthat both recommender systems and nudges could affect long term\\nhabits [31, 54].\\nFor our third research question (RQ3), we predicted the health-\\niness of recipes (FSA score). The results suggest that the number\\nof healthy eating goals that a user has, affects their recipe choices\\nat the health level. We have found the effect is moderated by the\\nperceived choice difficulty. This suggests that a non-confusing, un-\\nambiguous decision environment is more effective at facilitating\\nthe healthy eating goals of users. In terms of other user charac-\\nteristics, such as level of education and cooking experience, we\\nhave observed no other significant predictors. We further find that\\npersonalization positively correlates with FSA score. This suggests\\nthat a high level of preference matching with the recommended\\nrecipes can lead to unhealthy choices.\\nFinally, we conclude our discussion section by proposing novel\\nresearch questions, as a guide for future work. Some of these ques-\\ntions can also be applied to recommender domains beyond food:\\n•How can other types of nudging strategies (e.g., defaults,\\nsocial norms) be integrated with (food) recommender ap-\\nproaches to facilitate better (i.e., for food: healthier) decision-\\nmaking?\\n•How can user eating goals be integrated with both the sug-\\ngested content and the decision context of a recommender\\nsystem?\\n•To what extent do short-term food choices contribute to\\nbehavioral change in the long term?\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nThis work was supported by industry partners and the Research\\nCouncil of Norway with funding to MediaFutures: Research Centre\\nfor Responsible Media Technology and Innovation, through the\\ncenters for Research-based Innovation scheme, project number\\n309339.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] Himan Abdollahpouri, Robin Burke, and Bamshad Mobasher. 2017.

For\\nfood recommendation, users differ in terms of the needs they have.

In an online study (2x2 between-subjects design;𝑁 = 244 ), we\\ncompared a constraint-based recipe recommender, with feature-based PE, to a collaborative filtering\\nrecipe recommender with rating-based PE. Recipes were either annotated with a multiple traffic light\\nnutrition label (i.e. the boost), or not (i.e., baseline). We found that boosts led to healthier recipe choices\\nacross both methods of PE.

Introduction\\nMost recommender systems assume that people have both the capabilities and interest to make\\nfully-informed choices. That is, interaction data such as ratings and bookmarks are assumed\\nto be accurate reflections of one’s preferences [1, 2]. While this goes a long way in some\\ndomains, for example in movies, recommenders in other domains face users that have specific\\nneeds or wishes that they cannot always disclose to the system [3], or require users to be more\\nexperienced to make well-informed decisions [4, 5, 6].\\nIn food recommender systems, which present personalized food or recipe content to users [7],\\none’s preferences may strongly depend on contextual factors. This not only includes the ‘in-\\nperson’ context, such as the time of day and allergies, but alsohow the food items are presented\\nin the digital interface. For example, one’s preferences for a specific burger recipe may strongly\\ndepend on whether salad recipes are presented alongside it, or whether the nutritional content\\nIntRS’22: Joint Workshop on Interfaces and Human Decision Making for Recommender Systems, September 22, 2022,\\nSeattle, US (hybrid event)\\nEnvelope-Open alain.starke@wur.nl (A.

       " 'ofthatburgerisemphasized. Moreover, someusersmayfinditdifficulttoelicittheirpreferences\\nif they have specific needs [8]. For example, a user of a collaborative filtering recommender\\nthat only optimizes for ratings may find it difficult to locate recipes without specific features,\\nsuch as gluten-free content.\\nOne overarching theme in food recommender systems is to support healthier choices [9].\\nMost food recommenders are, however, still optimized towards popularity [10, 8], leading to\\nunhealthy outcomes [11]. The number of food recommender studies that examine how to\\noptimize for a user’s nutritional needs, such as through knowledge-based methods [12], is rather\\nsmall [9, 8]. Even so, most of the research has focused on algorithmic advancements in terms of\\nprediction accuracy and less so on the healthiness of chosen recipes and the user’s evaluation\\n[13, 14].\\nIn this paper, we examine recipe choices and a user’s evaluation for two recommender aspects\\nthat go beyond algorithmic accuracy and the presented content. First, we investigate to what\\nextent ‘boosting’ can support healthier recipe choices in a food recommender context. Like\\nnudges [15, 16], boosts are changes to a choice architecture that lead to predictable changes in\\nbehavior [17]. Whereas nudges can also be unconscious and a user is not always aware of them\\n[18, 16], boosts aim to empower users in their decision-making by increasing their competence\\n[17], typically by providing more information [19]. In this sense, boosts tend to be regarded as\\nethically more acceptable, due to their explicitness [20]. A common approach to ‘boost’ healthy\\nfood choices in brick-and-mortar supermarkets is the use of front-of-package labels [21, 22].\\nSuch labels summarize the nutritional content of a product, indicating how consuming it relates\\nto one’s allowed daily intake for different nutrients [23]. A commonly used label in the United\\nKingdom, is the Multiple Traffic Light label, which has shown to be effective in supporting\\n‘offline’ healthy food choices [24]. However, their effectiveness in an online context, as well as\\nfor recipes, is less clear.\\nSecond,weinvestigatetheroleoftheusedpreferenceelicitationmethodonauser’sevaluation\\nof a food recommender system. Whereas content-based and CF-based recommender typically\\nask users to interact with individual items (cf. [25, 26]), other types of recommenders seek to\\nexploit the relation between user characteristics and recipe features, such as knowledge-based\\nrecommender systems [27, 12]. Not only does this affect what items are presented, but possibly\\nalso on how users perceive and experience the interaction. Previous research in the energy\\nrecommender domain has shown that the interplay between the used preference elicitation\\nmethod and a user’s domain knowledge affects the user’s evaluation [4]. They show that\\ninexperienced users tend to prefer to rate the favorability of individual items (i.e., in this case:\\nenergy-saving measures), while more experienced users could interact with the measures’\\nfeatures (e.g., ‘effort’ and ‘savings’) [28, 4]. For the recipe domain, this implies that preference\\nelicitation through recipe features, as in a constraint-based recommender, would be preferred\\nby users with a high level of experience.\\nWe argue that the extent to which users are interested in recipe healthiness can affect how\\nthey evaluate a recommender system and its preference elicitation method. On the one hand, in\\na collaborative filtering context, users can only indicate their interest in healthier recipes by\\nrating specific recipes, while this might be easier in a recommender system that inquires on\\nspecific nutrition-related features, such as knowledge-based or constraint-based recommenders.\\nOn the other hand, users who aware of health and nutrition might be able to pick specific',\n",
       " 'recipes that fit their needs and would experience feature-based elicitation as not fully meeting\\ntheir needs. To this end, we consider a user’s level of health consciousness, which measures\\none’s perception of one’s diet and the relation between nutrient intake and health [29]. This\\naspect is adapted from pre-validated scales, used in nutritional studies [30, 29].\\nApproaches in food recommender systems promotes popular and unhealthy content, while\\nuser preferences tend to be more complex to be extracted. We propose the following research\\nquestions:\\n• RQ1: To what extent does a ‘nutrition label boost’ steer users towards healthier recipe\\nchoices in a recommender system context?\\n• RQ2: To what extent does a user’s evaluation of a food recommender system depend\\non the interplay between a user’s health consciousness and the system’s preference\\nelicitation method?\\nWe present an online recommender study in which users can disclose their preferences for\\nrecipes,afterwhichtheyarepresentedapersonalizedrecommendationlist. Bycomparingrecipe\\nlists with and without nutrition labels and by using different preference elicitation methods, we\\nshow that:\\n• Healthier recipe choices can be supported by boosts, without changing the recommended\\ncontent.\\n• A user’s perception (i.e., effort) and evaluation (i.e., choice difficulty and satisfaction)\\nare more favorable among users of a constraint-based recommender with a low level of\\nhealth consciousness, and vice versa for a collaborative filtering recommender.\\n2. Methodology\\n2.1. Dataset\\nWe consulted a database that comprised recipes of Allrecipes.com, used in previous food\\nrecommender systems studies (e.g., [11, 14]). From the total of 58000+ recipes, we extracted a\\nsample of 991 recipes. Our dataset included the basic metadata for each recipe, such as image\\nURLs,servingsizes,thenumberofingredients,preparationtimes,calories,sugar,salt,(saturated)\\nfat, and protein.

       " '2.2. Recommender Approaches\\nTo address our research questions, and specifically RQ2, we compared two recommender ap-\\nproaches that were distinct in terms of their preference elicitation (PE) methods1. Collaborative\\nFiltering (CF) relies on rating-based PE, asking users to indicate preferences for individual\\nitems (i.e., recipes). Such approaches tend to outperform other item-based PE methods, such\\nas content-based recommendation [31]. In contrast, Constraint-based (CB) recommendation\\nexploits user preferences for recipe features, retrieving content based on the relation between\\nuser characteristics and recipe features. Both of the selected approaches involve explicit pref-\\nerence elicitation, as this was found to be the best representation of user preferences in food\\ndomain [8].\\n2.2.1. Collaborative Filtering (CF)\\nBefore implementing the CF-based recommender, we evaluated several rating-based prediction\\nalgorithms in an offline setting using out dataset. The results of this analysis were also reported\\nin [32]. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) [33] was found to outperform algorithms (e.g.,\\nSVD++, KNNBasline, NMF ) by 10% in terms of the Root Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute\\nError, and was deployed for our online evaluation.\\nAs part of the study, users were presented 10 recipes to rate on a 5-point scale. These\\nrecipes were all part of a preferred cuisine by the user (cf. subsection2.3). Subsequently, a\\nlist of ten recipes was retrieved that was closest to the inferred user profile, based on the SVD\\nrecommender. Five recipes were retrieved from a healthy set, and the other five were retrieved\\nfrom a less healthy set ( cf. subsection2.5.1 ).\\n2.2.2.

Rather\\nthanrelyingontherelationbetweenusercharacteristicsandrecipefeatures, suchaswasdonein\\nthe knowledge-based recommender of Musto et al. [12], we focused on ‘pure’ feature-based PE,\\nwhich was consistent with Knijnenburg et al. [4]. The recommendation process was initiated\\nby asking users what type of recipes they preferred, based on the food category and different\\nfeatures. Features addressed different aspects, such as practicalities (i.e., number of servings)\\nand health (i.e., preferred amount of calories). An overview of features is depicted in Figure\\n1. After obtaining feature-based preferences, a similarity function was used to score recipes\\n(based on [27]), eventually retrieving recipes that were deemed most relevant.\\n2.3.

We used the well-\\nvalidated FSA score [36], which was issued by the British Food Standards Agency [37]. The FSA\\nscore was computed by assigning points to four nutrients in a given recipe: sugar, fat, saturated\\nfat, and salt. For each nutrient, we discerned between low, medium, or high content, assigning\\none point for each level (low, medium, high). This led to a scored scale from 4 (healthiest) to 12\\n(least healthy). We used a score of eight as a threshold to discern 50% healthy and 50% unhealthy\\nrecipes in our recommendation sets.',\n",

Nutrition Labels\\nFor our boosting intervention, we relied on a Front-of-Package Nutrition Label to inform users\\nabout the health content of recipes. For years, food products displayed nutritional details on\\nthe back of packaging. Although this was found to be associated with low-fat food intake and\\nhealthier food choices overall [38, 39], many people found the information too complex to use\\n[40, 41]. This spurred the development of Front-of-Package labels that summarize a product’s\\nnutritional content [42].\\nIn this study, we used the Multiple Traffic Light (MTL) Front-of-Package nutrition label as a\\nhealthy eating boost (see Figure2B). The MTL label was based on the FSA score, representing\\ndifferent levels of nutrient content by displaying red, amber, or green colors for high, medium,\\nor low levels of nutrients, respectively [37].\\n2.5.3. User Characteristics, Perception, and Experience\\nTo examine the user’s evaluation of our food recommender approaches, we inquired on user\\ncharacteristics and evaluation aspects. In line with the recommender system user experience\\nframework [43, 44], we examined perception and experience aspects and user characteristics.\\nItem responses were submitted to 5-point Likert Scales. Items for choice satisfaction [43, 45, 14],\\nchoice difficulty [46, 14], and perceived effort [6] were adapted from previous recommender\\nstudies. Item for health consciousness was adapted from a pre-validated scale in the food\\ndomain [30, 29], in line with a procedure followed by [47].\\nWhether the items formed the expected aspects was examined using a principal component\\nfactor analysis. Table2 outlines the results, describing the factor loadings for the used aspects\\nand items. Items with low loadings or too many cross-loadings were removed from analysis.\\nWhereas choice difficulty, choice satisfaction and perceived effort could be inferred reliably,',\n",
       " 'there were doubts about the reliability of health consciousness. We observed a low value of\\nCronbach’s Alpha (0.37), even after dropping unreliable items.

Results\\nWe present the analyses for our two research questions. First, we investigated to what extent\\nannotating recipes with nutrition labels, with (i.e., boosting) or without (i.e., nudging) expla-\\nnation, led to healthier recipe choices (RQ1). Second, we examined the interplay between the\\nused Preference Elicitation (PE) method and user’s evaluation method, specifically examining\\nhow the user’s health consciousness and the PE method led to differences in user perception\\n(i.e., perceived effort) and evaluation (i.e., choice difficulty and choice satisfaction; RQ2).\\n3.1. RQ1: Boosting Towards Healthier Choices\\nWe first examined to what extent nutrition label boosted affected the healthiness of recipes\\nchosen. We performed a two-way ANCOVA to predict whether the FSA score of chosen recipes',\n",
       " 'differed significantly across conditions, while adjusting for a user’s level of health consciousness.\\nWith regard to the labeling conditions, the results in Table3 show that the FSA score was\\nsignificantly lower in the boost condition (𝑀 = 7.98 , 𝑆𝐷 = 1.63 ) than in the no-label condition\\n(𝑀 = 8.65 , 𝑆𝐷 = 1.50 ): 𝐹 (1, 239) = 10.41 , 𝑝 = 0.0014 . This showed that in the context of\\npersonalized recipe recommendations, boosting and annotating recipes with a multiple traffic\\nlight nutrition label leads to an increase in the healthiness of recipe choices.\\nTable 3\\nResults of a two-way ANCOV A, predicting the healthiness of chosen recipes across different recom-\\nmendation approaches and interventions conditions.

Although chosen recipes were\\nslightly less healthier after a constraint-based (CB) PE and recommendation method (𝑀 = 8.39 ,\\n𝑆𝐷 = 1.39 ) than after a collaborative filtering (CF) PE (𝑀 = 8.23 , 𝑆𝐷 = 1.79 ), this difference was\\nnot significant (𝑝 = 0.42 ). This suggested that the used PE and recommendation method did\\nnot directly affect the recommended content.\\nIn addition, we neither observed an interaction effect between the PE method and the use of\\na boosted nutrition label. To better understand all effects, please inspect Figure4, which shows\\nthat users across both PE methods chose healthier recipes when being presented nutrition labels.\\nFinally, Table3 did not reveal that a user’s level of health consciousness significantly affected\\nthe healthiness of chosen recipes (𝑝 = 0.057 ); we further checked for interaction effects with\\nthe labelling conditions, but did not observe any.\\n3.1.1. Conclusion\\nOverall, we found that annotating recipes with multiple traffic light nutrition labels, in conjunc-\\ntion with an explanation, can support users in making healthier choices. On the other hand,\\nthe recommendation approach did not affect on the healthiness of chosen recipes (see Table\\n3), nor was it affected by a user’s level of health consciousness. Recipe choices were further\\nrelated to how users evaluated our recommender system in the next subsection.\\n3.2. RQ2: User Evaluation of Preference Elicitation Methods\\nWe examined a user’s evaluation of our recipe recommender system, based on the used Prefer-\\nence Elicitation (PE) method.

This showed that how a food recommender is evaluated depends\\non the healthy food interests of the user, which is one of the possible user characteristics that\\ncould have been inquired on.\\n4. Discussion\\nIn the context of personalized recipe recommendations, this work has examined two ways how\\na recommender can cater to users who are interested in healthy eating. Food recommender\\nsystems have faced difficulties in optimizing for nutritional content [9, 10, 11], particularly\\nwhile maintaining a user’s level of satisfaction [36]. In an attempt to ‘boost’ healthier recipe\\nchoices, we have gone beyond optimizing algorithmic accuracy by not necessarily changing\\nwhat recipes are presented but how they are presented and how user preferences are elicited.\\nFirst, we have found that annotating recipes with nutrition labels leads to healthier recipe\\nchoices (RQ1). Our work is among the first to examine such a digital nudge in a personalized\\ncontext [48], particularly in the domain food [49], and one of the first to use the concept of\\n‘boosting’ in a recommender system context. The idea that our (interface) interventions, not\\nonly the algorithm, should be explainable to a person or user is gaining ground in behavioral\\neconomics [17, 20]. The purpose of highlighting a specific interface this way is to make it more\\nsalient to a user, which can increase one’s knowledge level or awareness [50]. Although it seems\\nsensible that a nutrition label can support healthier choices [40], evidence for the effectiveness\\nof nudges in personalized recommender contexts is scarce [45]. It seems that they need to be\\nwell-designed to be effective, as the content already fits the user’s preferences.\\nSecond,wehavefoundthattheuser’sevaluationofafoodrecommendersystemissignificantly\\nassociated with the used preference elicitation method, based on that user’s level of health\\nconsciousness (RQ2). We have compared two distinct recommender approaches, collaborative\\nfiltering and constraint-based, that also involve different methods of preference. Across all types\\nof users, we find that constraint-based recipe recommendation lists are more difficult to choose',\n",
       " 'from and, in turn, lead to lower levels of satisfaction. With regard to choice satisfaction, it could\\nbe argued that this outcome is unsurprising, since a constraint-based recommender system\\ntends to be less effective than a CF-based recommender as it makes much simpler assumptions\\nabout the user’s preferences [51].\\nWhen combining health consciousness and the PE method, we would have expected to\\nobserve an additional interaction effect. Hence, our user-specific analyses are more striking.\\nSimilar to the interaction between knowledge and the PE method in [28], we have observed an\\ninteraction effect between health consciousness and the PE method. However, although we have\\nobserved lower perceived effort for lower levels of health consciousness and feature-based PE,\\nprevious findings from the energy domain show the opposite withhigher system satisfaction\\nlevels for high domain knowledge and feature-based PE [28, 4]. we argue that the examined\\ninterplay of user characteristics and PE is different. Whereas the work of Knijnenburg et\\nal. [4] focuses on domain knowledge and the resulting understandability of different energy-\\nrelated features, the current paper focuses on whether a specific aspect in which users can\\nbe interested (i.e., food healthiness) can be catered to effectively using different PE methods.\\nWhether similar findings would be observed when examining the relation between PE and food\\nknowledge (e.g., subjective food knowledge [52, 53]) will be examined in an upcoming study.\\nRegardless, our findings stress the complexity and multifacetedness of the food domain [7], the\\ndomain-specificity of findings in recommender studies.\\nThemainlimitationto ourfindingsit thathealthconsciousness facedconstructvalidity issues.\\nAlthough the factor loadings of the eventually used items are good, the observed Cronbach’s\\nAlpha was found to be too low and multiple items were dropped. This can raise some doubts\\nabout whether we have measured health consciousness reliably. Although we wholeheartedly\\nrecommended to replicate our findings, we have proceeded with our analysis in the current\\npaper, because the used items are part of a pre-validated scale [30], implying that some studies\\nhave already used the scale without validating it further (e.g., [47]).\\nAnother aspect that can be improved is the method of analysis. Whereas Knijnenburg et al.\\n[4] has examined mediation effects using structural equation modelling, this was not possible\\nin the current study due to fit issues. We have not been even to converge to a model that would\\nmeet all assumptions. Instead, we have examined a simplified version of a structural equation\\nmodel, by examining mediation through multiple separate analyses (i.e., ANCOVAs, regression).\\nThis approach is line with the earlier 2009 RecSys work of Knijnenburg and Willemsen [28],\\ninferring mediation in a stepwise manner. This approach is also prescribed by Baron and\\nKenny [54]. Nonetheless, it has been argued that this approach faces more limitation than\\na structural equation model would [55]. Hence, in a follow-up study, we intend to mitigate\\nthe issues regarding construct validity examine our findings in a structural equation model\\nby using different questionnaire items. Even though health consciousness has been adapted\\nfrom previous studies [30, 29], we opt for pre-validated aspects in a follow-up study. In doing\\nso, we will also consider subjective food knowledge scales, which would be in line with the\\nearlier work on PE from Knijnenburg et al. [4]. All in all, this would allow us to paint a full\\npicture of the interplay between a food recommender’s PE method and multiple relevant user\\ncharacteristics that cannot simply be captured by a recommender algorithm.\\nA limitation regarding the recommended items is the arguably smaller dataset of recipes.\\nWhile some other studies with internet-sourced recipes have been able to leverage datasets',\n",
       " 'with more recipes [11], our dataset is smaller due to the focus on high-quality ratings for our\\ncollaborative filtering recommender. We have only used ratings from users that have rated at\\nleast 20 recipes, to make sure that the collected ratings are of rather active and experienced\\nusers. In addition,\\nFollow-up studies should also address the limitations of one-off user choices as a measure\\nof recommender ‘success’. While food choices may go a long way in digital interfaces to\\npredict subsequent user behavior (e.g., [56]), an optimal study design would also check whether\\nchosen recipes are actually prepared and consumed. In a sense, repeated interactions with\\na recommender systems through some kind of application would be representative to assess\\nwhether user preferences would shift. Therefore, we opt for a recommender systems with a\\nlongitudinal design, as has been demonstrated in other domains [57].\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis work was supported by industry partners and the Research Council of Norway with\\nfunding to MediaFutures: Research Centre for Responsible Media Technology and Innovation,\\nthrough the centers for Research-based Innovation scheme, project number 309339.\\nReferences\\n[1] W.

Some recipes\\nare more challenging to understand or cook than others [3], where users may lack sufficient\\nfood knowledge or skills to engage with them [4]. For example, while some users have clear\\npreferences regarding specific recipe features, such as cooking time and the number of ingredi-\\nents, others may make food choices based on past positive experiences with a recipe and seek\\nout ‘more like this’ [5].\\nThe large availability of recipes requires the use of information-filtering systems. Food\\nrecommender systems have played an instrumental role in the popularity of recipe website [6],\\nIntRS ’23: 10th Joint Workshop on Interfaces and Human Decision Making for Recommender Systems at the 17th ACM\\nConference on Recommender Systems (RecSys ’23), September 18–22, 2023, Singapore\\n/envel⌢pe-⌢penayoub.majjodi@uib.no (A.

However, eating is a particularly challenging\\ndomain to achieve robust improvements in accuracy when aiming to go beyond popularity-\\nbased approaches. Food preferences strongly depend on various factors, such as context [8],\\ngroup size [9], time of the day, and the day of the week [2].\\nImprovements may therefore be sought in other recommender aspects. User preferences are\\nalso formed by how information is presented, combined with the user’s level of understanding\\n[10, 9]. While users may have a specific eating goal (e.g., health or sustainability [ 5]), the\\ninformation presented by recommenders may be too limited to make an informed decision\\n[11]. To this end, summary labels, as also used on supermarket products, may help to grasp the\\nhealthiness or nutritional content of a recipe, particularly for novice users.\\nThe user’s knowledge may also affect how a recommender’s preference elicitation method is\\nevaluated. In the energy conservation domain, a domain subject to behavioral change [12], a\\nuser’s evaluation of a preference elicitation (PE) method seems to depend on the user’s level of\\ndomain knowledge [10, 13]. Users that do not know much about energy conservation tend to\\nbe more satisfied when using a case-based PE method, in which individual items are (dis)liked.\\nIn contrast, experienced users are found to be more satisfied when interacting with attributes\\nof energy-saving measures, such as effort and investment costs.\\nWe argue that a similar dynamic applies to the food recommender domain. We expect novice\\nusers of recipe recommenders and websites to incrementally explore recipes based on what they\\nliked previously, as one would in a content-based method [7]. In contrast, experienced users\\nwould seek out new recipes more easily based on preferred attributes, as one would through a\\nknowledge-based method [14].\\nThis paper examines the role of user knowledge on decisions in a recipe recommender system.\\nInstead of following an algorithmic optimization approach that only focuses on user preferences\\n[7], we examine the influence of two other recommender aspects: food labels and preference\\nelicitation methods. A user’s domain knowledge is critical here, regarding the most optimal\\ninterface representation or interaction method.\\nFirst, we apply digital, informational nudges to recommendation lists in the form of nutrition\\nand health labels. In the food domain, these have been used primarily in supermarkets to\\ncommunicate nutrition information to consumers in a simplified manner [15, 16]. Most notable\\nare summary labels, such as the Nutriscore to classify foods between A and E. Most popular is\\nthe Multiple Traffic Light (MTL) label [17], which uses colors to indicate (un)healthy intakes of\\nfour nutrients: fat, saturated fat, sugar, and salt. This study considers two labels, with varying\\ndegrees of difficulty: The MTL label and the back-of-pack nutritional facts [17].\\nSecond, we examine the role of two different PE methods. First, we develop a content-based\\nrecommender in which a user picks a favorite recipe from a randomly generated list of recipes.\\nSecond, we develop a knowledge-based recommender system in which users indicate their\\npreferences for recipes based on a set of attributes, such as cooking time and difficulty. We\\nexpect that user choices might be affected by the use of labels, and the evaluation depends on\\nthe interplay between user knowledge levels and either the labels or PE methods used. We\\nformulate the following research questions:\\n• RQ1: To what extent do different nutrition labels support healthier recipe choices?',\n",
       " 'Ayoub El Majjodi et al. CEUR Workshop Proceedings –\\n• RQ2: Does the user evaluation of a recipe recommender system depend on the interplay\\nbetween food knowledge and different preference elicitation methods?\\n2. Related Work\\n2.1. Food Recommender Systems\\nThe field of recommender systems has received considerable research attention due to the\\ncomplex and fundamental nature of food [ 6, 2]. However, most studies have focused on im-\\nproving prediction accuracy [9]. To this end, various techniques have been explored. While\\ncontent-based approaches are initially found to outperform other methods (e.g., collaborative,\\nknowledge-based) [7], collaborative filtering has also yielded better results in other studies [2].\\nA recurring problem is to support healthier food and recipe choices. There is an apparent\\ntradeoff between ‘user preferences’ and health in recipe recommendation [6], particularly due to\\nthe popularity of unhealthy recipes [1]. Rather than restricting content based on health, various\\nstudies have examined hybrid solutions (e.g., through post ranking on health [18]) and interface\\nsolutions. For example, multi-list interfaces have been developed to support healthier eating\\ngoals, where multi-list recommenders are evaluated more favorably than single-list interfaces\\n[5].\\nNonetheless, very few studies have explored the impact of preference elicitation methods on\\nuser evaluation, particularly not in relation to a user’s knowledge level. Research that presents\\nnovel preference elicitation (PE) methods typically involve conversational recipe recommenders\\n[19]. For example, two studies have compared the effect of using different modalities on user\\nchoice or evaluation [20, 21]. While these modalities might affect how a user experiences an\\ninteraction or even what item is chosen, these modality types seem to bear no relation to a\\nuser’s knowledge level. Thus, the current study aims to fill this gap by empirically examining\\nthe effects of different preference elicitation methods and subjective food knowledge on the\\nuser experience.\\n2.2. Adaptive Preference Elicitation Methods\\nAcross all recommender domains, several preference elicitation (PE) approaches have been\\nproposed and evaluated [2]. One of the earlier works in the food domain was [7], following a\\nrather simplistic procedure where recipe ratings are obtained from users and transferred into\\ningredient ratings. While the user could still interact with individual recipes (as also in [22]),\\nthe system then aggregated the ratings of the ingredients to generate rating predictions.\\nMore extensive approaches would include user preferences for individual recipes and at-\\ntributes. Elahi et al. [23] consider additional factors when building a recommendation model,\\nby including user food preferences, nutritional indicators, and ingredient costs. This results in\\na model that combines the predicted value of a recipe along with the above-noted factors to\\ngenerate recommendations.\\nFood recommender studies do not explicitly discern between PE methods. In the end, most\\nmethods are simply a requirement for following a specific recommender model. Knowledge-\\nbased food recommender studies elicit extensive recipe attribute preferences [ 14, 24], while',\n",
       " 'Ayoub El Majjodi et al. CEUR Workshop Proceedings –\\ncontent-based and collaborative approaches can deal with interactions at the individual recipe\\nlevel. To date, besides a preliminary study [22], it has not been considered that specific users,\\nbased on their knowledge or capabilities, may prefer specific PE methods or require specific\\ninformation to be presented in a food recommender interface.\\nThe interplay between user characteristics and PE methods is investigated in the energy\\nconservation domain. Knijnenburg and Willemsen [ 10] compare two preference elicitation\\nmethods for a household energy recommender system. Users of a case-based PE method\\ncould indicate to (dis)like individual energy-saving measures (e.g., ‘turn off the lights after\\nleaving a room’). In contrast, users of an attribute-based PE method could either decrease or\\nincrease the weights of different energy-saving attributes, such as ‘investment costs’ or ‘effort’.\\nThey find, also in follow-up studies [ 13], that users with high domain knowledge are more\\nsatisfied when using an attribute-based PE method, while users with lower domain knowledge\\nprefer case-based PE. As food PE methods can also be differentiated in terms of interacting\\nwith individual recipes (i.e., case-based, such as in content-based recommendation) and recipe\\nfeatures (i.e., feature-based, such as in knowledge-based recommendation), we expect to observe\\nan interaction effect between food knowledge and the PE method on how a recommender is\\nevaluated.\\n2.3. Nutrition Labels and Digital Nudging\\nNutritional information about food and recipes might not always be apparent to users. This is\\nanother area where the user’s domain knowledge may affect their preferences, particularly in\\ncases where it is either emphasized or not.\\nOne way to communicate the healthiness of foods and recipes is through nutrition labels [17].\\nOne category is back-of-package labels that outline the nutritional contents of a food product in\\ndetail [25]. Another category is front-of-package (FoP) labels that are used for both products and\\nrecipes, which typically summarize the product’s or recipe’s nutritional content. For example,\\nthis could be by highlighting specific nutrients of aggregating nutrition information towards a\\nscore [17, 25].\\nThe health benefits of such FoP labels have been shown longitudinally, supporting healthy\\nfood intake [26]. While a growing body of evidence supports the effectiveness of FoP nutrition\\nlabels in promoting healthy food choices in physical settings, the impact of nutrition labels in\\ndigital contexts has been relatively understudied [16]. In particular, little is known about the\\neffectiveness of FoP labels in personalized environments [27].\\nFoP labels can be regarded as a digital nudge, a change in an interface that leads to predictable\\nchoices [28]. More specifically, such a label is a cognitively oriented healthy eating nudge [15],\\nas users are encouraged to re-consider their preferences and choices based on deliberation.\\nSome of these labels, such as the Multiple Traffic Light (MTL) label, is also accompanied by a\\ncoloring system, which supports intuitive decision-making [29].\\nVarious digital nudges mainly relate to interface aspects of food recommenders. For example,\\nvisual and textual explanations have been shown to shift user preferences towards healthier\\nrecipes [30, 24]. This study mainly builds upon earlier work where ‘boosting’ is examined to\\nfirst explain FoP labels to users, after which recipes are annotated with them [22]. This has led\\nto a higher proportion of healthier choices in the recommender interface. Instead of applying',\n",
       " 'Ayoub El Majjodi et al. CEUR Workshop Proceedings –\\n‘boosts’ in this study, we seek to examine the effectiveness of two cognitive, informational\\nnudges. To examine the differentiating effect of user knowledge when combined with nudges,\\nwe either annotate recipes with back-of-package labels (i.e., Nutritional Facts label1) or Multiple\\nTraffic Light (MTL) labels [31]. We expect that users with higher levels of domain knowledge\\nare better able to understand the full back-of-package label, compared to the MTL label also\\nbeing appropriate for low-knowledge users.\\n2.4. Objectives\\nWe extend previous work of food recommender systems [6], by examining the role of preference\\nelicitation methods and digital nudges (through nutrition labels) [28, 10, 13]. First, we investigate\\nhow different labeling systems can facilitate healthier decision-making when selecting recipes\\n(RQ1). We compare two label-based scenarios (with either an MTL label or a ‘full’ back-of-pack\\nlabel) with a no-label baseline, focusing on the interplay between labels and the preference\\nelicitation method and how this affects the user’s evaluation. In doing so, we also consider a\\nuser’s knowledge level and the preference elicitation method.\\nSecond, we examine the impact of the interplay of user knowledge and preference elicitation\\nmethods on user choice and evaluation. We differentiate between two methods, content-based\\nand knowledge-based, being ‘case-based’ or ‘attribute-based’ PE methods, respectively; in line\\nwith Knijnenburg et al. [ 13]. For the content-based approach, users are asked to indicate\\nwhether they like individual recipes, while the knowledge-based approach elicits preferences\\nbased on recipe features and personal characteristics, such as cooking time and self-reported\\nweight goals. In line with Knijnenburg and Willemsen [ 32], we used Structural Equations\\nModeling (SEM) to construct a path model, in which changes to the recommender were related\\nto perception aspects and, in turn, experience aspects.\\n3. Study Design\\n3.1. Dataset\\nTo address our research questions, we used a dataset from the popular recipe website All-\\nrecipes.com. From the larger corpus of 58,000 recipes, we sampled 5,000 recipes from different\\nfood categories for the main dish. In addition to the recipe title, all nutrients required to build\\nthe recommender were extracted.\\n3.2. Recommender Approaches\\nWe employed two recommendation approaches, both of which rely on explicit preference\\nelicitation methods [9].\\n3.2.1. Content-based (CB)\\nThe content-based recommender system generated recommendations based on similarity with\\nrecipes liked by the user. It employed the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-\\n1https://www.fda.gov/food/new-nutrition-facts-label/how-understand-and-use-nutrition-facts-label',\n",

The\\ningredient list was vectorized, operationalizing TF as the weight (per 100g) present in the\\nrecipe. To build a user model in our study, we presented a list of 10 recipes to the user that\\nincluded detailed descriptions of their ingredients, pictures, servings, and calorie information.\\nFor computing the final recommendations for the user, we computed similarities between the\\nuser and item profile, employing a cosine similarity metric and the ingredient vectors (cf. [14]).\\nThis method adhered to the standard methods in food recommender systems and had been\\nshown to generate decent results in the domain of food recommendations where no collaborative\\nfiltering is possible [33].\\n3.2.2. Knowledge-based (KB)\\nWe developed a knowledge-aware recommender system that extended the work of Musto et al.\\n[14]. An overview of elicited features is described in Table 1. Users were asked to disclose\\npersonal characteristics and practical and health-related preferences related to recipes. A\\nscore-based ranker used encoded knowledge relations between user factors and recipe features\\nto recipes, based on the user’s profile. The scores are adjusted based on metadata such as\\ningredients or nutritional value. Table 1 also presents the rules to score recipes based on the\\nuser needs, which is among others based on information found in [34, 35, 36, 24].\\nTable 1\\nUser Factors and rules to score and generate relevant recipes.

Grounds for exclusion were based on multiple\\nviolations of non-attentiveness: not disclosing realistic knowledge-based criteria (e.g., a weight\\nof 15kg), providing uniform responses in the user evaluation questionnaires, and/or completing\\nthe study in under 2 minutes. Our final analysis was performed on a sample of 306 (65% female)\\nparticipants split equally on study conditions, with an average age of 30.5 years.\\n3.4.1. Ethical Statement\\nThis research adhered to the ethical guidelines of the University of Bergen and the Norwegian\\nguidelines for scientific research. It was judged to pass without further extensive review, for it\\ncontained no misleading information, stress tasks, nor would it elicit extreme emotions.\\n3.5. Measures\\n3.5.1. Recipe Healthiness\\nTo determine the healthiness of the recipes in our dataset, we utilized the FSA score. It was\\nintroduced by the UK Food Standards Agency [ 31] and is considered a reliable measure to\\nestimate recipes’ healthiness. It was successfully used in multiple human-computer interaction\\nand recommender systems studies on recipes [1, 22, 20, 18]. The metric represented an inverse\\nhealthiness score and ranged from 4 (very healthy) to 12 (not healthy). It was based on the\\nlevels of fat, saturated fat, sugar, and salt per 100g in a recipe, adhering to nutritional intake\\nguidelines. For our algorithmic sampling, we classified recipes as healthy up to a score of 8,\\nwhile higher scores were designated as unhealthy.\\n3.5.2. Food knowledge and user evaluation\\nTo measure the users’ nutritional knowledge levels, we employed the Subjective Food Knowledge\\n(SFD) questionnaire, which was validated in prior studies [ 37, 38]. The SFD questionnaire\\ncomprised five items, that are rated on a five-point Likert scale.\\nA user’s experience of using our system was assessed through the recommender system\\nevaluation framework Knijnenburg and Willemsen [32]. For this study, we expected changes\\nin terms of how effortful a user perceived the interaction to be, while also inquiring on two\\ndifferent choice outcomes: choice difficulty and choice satisfaction. These two experience\\naspects are commonly used to evaluate recommender interactions [32, 13]. All questionnaire\\nitems b used for the user evaluation were previously validated in relevant domains through\\nearlier studies: for perceived effort [39], choice difficulty [40, 5], and choice satisfaction [12, 5].\\nAll items were submitted to a confirmatory factor analysis. Subjective food knowledge was\\nanalyzed separately to allow for interaction effects, while the other aspects were inferred as part\\nof a structural equation model analysis. Table 2 describes the factor loadings and Cronbach’s\\nAlpha, showing that items with low loadings (indicated in grey) were excluded from the analysis.\\nAll aspects adhered to internal consistency guidelines (𝛼 > .70), while they also met guidelines\\nfor convergent validity based on the average variance explained (𝐴𝑉 𝐸 >0.5).',\n",

Results\\nWe examined our research questions through two different analyses.

Second (RQ2), we investigated how users evaluated different labels\\nand preference elicitation (PE) methods through Structural Equation Modelling, also assessing\\nmediated relations. This analysis was performed in line with the recommender system user\\nexperience framework [32], relating our research design (objective system aspects) to user\\nperception (effort) and experience (choice difficulty and satisfaction) while considering user\\ncharacteristics (food knowledge) and behavior (healthiness of recipes chosen).\\n4.1. RQ1: Healthiness of Chosen Recipes\\nWe predicted the FSA score of chosen recipes based on the labels presented and the user\\npreference elicitation method. We also included food knowledge as a covariate and examined\\npossible interaction effects with PE or labels, but did not observe any.

Conclusion\\nWe found that annotating personalized recipes with either a Multiple Traffic Light or a Full\\nlabel did not significantly lead to healthier recipe choices. Although previous studies suggested\\nthe possible merit of labels in recommender systems [27, 22], we only observed a small, non-\\nsignificant (𝑝 = 0.054) improvement, particularly when using a front-of-pack Multiple Traffic\\nLight label. In contrast, the full, back-of-pack nutrition facts label led to similar outcomes as\\nin the baseline. As no interactions with food knowledge were found, this suggested that such\\ncognitive digital nudges are less effective in a personalized recommender context, and choice\\noutcomes do not depend on a label’s understandability.\\nWe did observe that a knowledge-based preference elicitation (PE) method led to healthier\\nrecipe choices. This indicated that a knowledge-based PE method could support users to\\nmake healthier choices, particularly by generating healthier recommendations as a translation',\n",

Our results revealed two ways in which choice satisfaction was affected.\\nFirst, users facing MTL labels tended to be more satisfied with their choices if they had a higher\\nknowledge level, while satisfaction levels were slightly lower on average for MTL. On the one\\nhand, this showed the importance of considering domain knowledge in the evaluation of a food\\nrecommender system, similar to [10]. On the other hand, it showed that although users of MTL',\n",
       " 'Ayoub El Majjodi et al. CEUR Workshop Proceedings –\\nlabels seemed to make slightly healthier choices (but not significantly so), it might have come\\nat the cost of choice satisfaction.\\nThe second main finding concerned the interplay between subjective food knowledge and\\nthe PE method. We found that both the perception and the experience of using the system\\ndepended on this interaction effect. Users with higher levels of domain knowledge evaluated\\na recommender more positively if it allowed them to disclose personal characteristics and\\nfeature-based preferences, as was done for the knowledge-based PE. In contrast, users with\\ncomparatively low levels of domain knowledge evaluated the recommender more positively\\nwhen facing a content-based method. Although the fully mediated path method was significant,\\nthis ‘crossed’ interaction effect was observed for all of the evaluative aspects.\\nOverall, this study showed that effective personalization in food recommender systems goes\\nbeyond algorithmic optimization. In fact, the design of the recommender, in terms of nudges\\nand PE methods, seemed to require careful consideration of the user’s knowledge level. This\\nsupport the calls for adaptive preference elicitation methods [10].\\n5. Discussion\\nFor many years, food recommender systems have fallen in line with traditional recommender\\napproaches, focusing on algorithmic optimization. This paper has built upon research in which\\nthe interaction methods and interface aspects of a recommender are adapted to support specific\\nuser choices [13]. We have singled out the role of a user’s level of domain knowledge, for it may\\naffect not only how recommendations are evaluated, but also what types of interface aspects and\\ninteraction methods are appropriate. In doing so, we have focused on the one hand on cognitive\\nfood nudges [15], in the form of nutrition labels. On the other hand, we have examined the role\\nof the recommender’s preference elicitation method [10, 13], regarding it as a possible barrier\\nfor some users to due to either its complexity (knowledge-based) or simplicity (content-based).\\nWe have set out with two research goals, examining two dimensions of a food recommender\\nsystem. Firstly, we sought to investigate whether food nutritional labels support recipe rec-\\nommender users in making healthy food choices. Secondly, we have examined the interplay\\nbetween subjective food knowledge and preference elicitation methods on the user’s perception\\nand experience in a food recommender system [32], being the first to do so in this domain.\\nThe first main contribution of this paper (RQ1) indicates that annotating personalized recipes\\nwith MTL labels or Full labels does not significantly affect the healthiness of recipes chosen by\\nusers. This finding falls in line with previous research in food recommender research [27, 22],\\nwhich found that boosting nutritional food labels is the best way to help users make healthier\\nfood choices in a personalized interface, rather than using nudges only. Hence, although digital\\nnudging in recommender systems has gained attention [28], its effectiveness might be limited\\ndue to the personalized decision-making context.\\nInterestingly, our study also reveals that a knowledge-based PE method (and subsequent\\nrecommender) leads to healthier outcomes than a more simple content-based recommender. It\\nis possible that simply allowing users to reflect on their own preferences and needs leads to\\nhealthier outcomes than relying on recipe ingredients and images only. In the context of the\\npsychological dual-process thinking [29], knowledge-based recommenders might encourage',\n",
       " 'Ayoub El Majjodi et al. CEUR Workshop Proceedings –\\nsystem-2 thinking, involving extensive and conscious deliberation, while content-based recom-\\nmenders might elicit intuitive choices (based on system-1). This is consistent with the type of\\nnudges related to effect (e.g., adapting images [18]) and cognition (e.g., labels) [15]. This also\\nhighlights the importance of considering user preferences and the interaction method, along\\nwith nutritional education, when examining food recommenders.\\nThe second main contribution concerns the interplay between the user’s nutritional knowl-\\nedge and the preference elicitation method. This interaction is shown to influence various\\nevaluative aspects of food recommender systems (RQ2). We find that users with higher levels\\nof food knowledge experience additional benefits when using a knowledge-based recommender\\nand vice versa for a content-based recommender. This has been operationalized into a path\\nmodel that includes perceived effort, choice difficulty, and choice satisfaction.\\nOur findings are largely consistent with the work done in the energy recommender system\\ndomain [13]. That work differentiates between ‘case-based PE’ and ‘attributed-based PE’, which\\nwe regard to be similar to our content-based and knowledge-based approaches, respectively.\\nWhere both case-based PE and content-based PE (dis)like individual recipes, attribute-based\\nPE differs slightly from a knowledge-based recommender. In [ 10, 13], users had to make\\ntradeoffs between different energy-saving measure features but did not disclose any personal\\ncharacteristics. In a knowledge-based recommender, the interactions that involve disclosing\\nneeds or personal preferences might have been easier to do, compared to some attribute-based\\ntradeoffs. Another difference is that we have not been able to relate the FSA score in our path\\nmodel to other aspects, while Knijnenburg et al. [13] also observe a relation between choice\\nsatisfaction and the interaction metric ‘kWhs saved’.\\nAnother striking finding from our structural equation model is that the evaluation of different\\nlabels depends on user knowledge. Where we expected this to be strongest for the full label due to\\nits complexity, we have observed a positive interaction between domain knowledge and the use\\nof an MTL label on choice satisfaction. It seems that the comparatively simple front-of-package\\nlabel [16] still requires a significant level of understanding to be used satisfactorily.\\n5.1. Limitations and Future Work\\nA few limitations might confound parts of this paper. Unfortunately, we have had to exclude\\naround 15% of our participants due to one or more issues regarding non-attention. The fact\\nthat this group is rather large could suggest that more users have not engaged with the recom-\\nmended content with much deliberation. Intuition-based decisions could have undermined the\\neffectiveness of our cognitive labeling nudge [15]. Nonetheless, since we have observed some\\ndifferences regarding labels in terms of choice and evaluation, we argue that a sufficient number\\nof participants is still part of this study’s analysis sample. This also applies to use of Structural\\nEquation Modelling, for which we had a sufficient number of degrees of freedom [41].\\nThe recommender in this study has focused on dinner recipes. Although this is quite a\\ncommon approach for recipe recommendation [ 27, 24, 5, 1], it is challenging to assess the\\nimplications or a slightly (un)healthier dinner meal if nothing is known about the daily dietary\\nintake of a user. For example, it could be that a person eats relatively healthy dinner meals but\\nhas numerous eating moments a day, thereby exceeding the caloric intake limit. We advocate\\nfor extending this recommender approach towards meal plans for the day, possibly mixing',\n",
       " 'Ayoub El Majjodi et al. CEUR Workshop Proceedings –\\nrecipe recommendations with food product recommendations.\\nAnother limitation, which is shared with many food recommender studies [2], is that we have\\nnot checked whether people actually cooked the food. In that sense, the choices made in this\\nstudy can only be regarded as behavioral intention. Although some commitment mechanisms\\nmay take place that may support actual engagement with chosen recipes, we would encourage\\nperforming a follow-up study that considers longitudinal aspects as well. An increasing number\\nof health-based personalized advice applications are developed [8], among others using Digital\\nTwins as a means of user profiling to suggest meal plans or exercise behavior. Overall, it is\\nimportant to examine whether adaptations in a recommender interface can spill over into\\nlonger last effects. For instance, a knowledge-based recommender can only be regarded as being\\neffective in supporting healthier choice if these last over the course of a few weeks.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis work was supported by industry partners and the Research Council of Norway with\\nfunding to MediaFutures: Research Centre for Responsible Media Technology and Innovation,\\nthrough the centers for Research-based Innovation scheme, project number 309339.\\nReferences\\n[1] C.

The majority of existing conversational recommender\\nsystems (CRSs) rely solely on natural language or basic click-based interactions.\\nThis work is one of the first studies to examine the influence of multi-modal interactions in a conversational food\\nrecommender system. In particular, we examined the effect of three distinct interaction modalities: pure textual, multi-modal\\n(text plus visuals), and multi-modal supplemented with nutritional labeling. We conducted a user study (𝑁=195) to evaluate\\nthe three interaction modalities in terms of how effectively they supported users in selecting healthier foods. Structural\\nequation modelling revealed that users engaged more extensively with the multi-modal system that was annotated with\\nlabels, compared to the system with a single modality, and in turn evaluated it as more effective.\\nKeywords\\nPersonalization, Health, Food recommendation, Digital Nudges, Nutrition labels\\n1.

While our food decisions are driven by\\nour overall preferences, the food selection process is\\nextremely contextual and influenced by a variety of\\nfactors, such as the user’s mood and dietary constraints.\\nMoreover, many of the decisions are made spontaneously\\nand consumers’ judgments are influenced by factors\\nunrelated to the food content, such as their perception\\nof the food’s visual characteristics [9]. For instance,\\nthe packaging of items with nutritional labels can\\nserve to highlight the nutritious nature of the food\\n(cf. [10]). Moreover, people generally prefer food that\\nhas a more visually appealing presentation, such as\\nfood that is presented in an attractive way [11].

In the field of food recommendation,\\nElsweiler et al.[20] provide a good frame of reference for\\nrecent advances in the field of food recommender sys-\\ntems in general. Specifically for conversational systems,\\nBarko-Sherif et al. [21] investigate the possibility for con-\\nversational preference elicitation in a food recommender\\nenvironment, using a Wizard of Oz study design (see also\\n[22]). Using a between-groups approach, they compare\\nspoken and text-input chat interfaces and reported that\\nsuchinterfacesareusefulforuserstodescribetheirneeds\\nand preferences. In other studies, Samagaio et al. [23]\\npresent a RASA-based chatbot that can recognize and cat-\\negorizeuserintentionsintheconversationaimedtoelicit\\nfood preferences for recommendation purposes. Another\\nstudy of Samagaio et al. [24] applies more knowledge-\\nbased elements based on word embedding to optimize\\nconversational ingredient retrieval. These studies, how-\\never, focus less on aspects pertaining to health, health la-\\nbelling, or elicitation modalities. In a non-conversational\\nrecommender context, El Majjodi et al. [25] recently in-\\ndicated that nutritional labels can reduce user’s choice\\ndifficulty in non-conversational context. The primary\\ndistinction between our work and previous studies is the\\nlack of multiple modalities (typically only text is used),\\nas well as that only a few studies (e.g., [25]) have used\\nnutrition labelling.\\nTo summarize, the goal of this study is to compare the\\nimpact of three user-system interaction and explanation\\nmodalities (textual, multi-modal, and multi-modal with\\nnutritional labels) on both behavioral aspects (what type\\nof recipe is chosen? How healthy is that recipe?) and\\nevaluation aspects (how does the user evaluate the sys-\\ntem or their chosen recipe?). Using a mediation analysis\\n(structural equation modelling), we answer the following\\nresearch question:\\n• RQ: Towhatextentdodifferentinteractionmodal-\\nities affect a user’s recipe choices and evaluation\\nin a conversational food recommendation sce-\\nnario?\\nTo address this question, we consider different dimen-\\nsionsofanalysis. Thisincludessysteminteractionlength,\\npresentation time, healthiness of recipes chosen and a\\nuser’s level of choice satisfaction and experienced system\\neffectiveness.\\n2. System Design\\nIn this section we describe the features of our conversa-\\ntional food recommender system, which supports users\\nin making healthier choices.1\\nWe designed a system-driven conversation in which the\\nsystem requires user feedback (response/input) to con-\\ntinue. The main steps of the conversational flow are\\nshown in Figure1. Users can interact with the system us-\\ning both buttons and textual messages2. The main steps\\nof the interaction are reported below:\\n• Food category acquisition: Theuserwaspresented\\nwith a choice offour different food categories\\nthat were considered in this work: Pasta, Salad,\\nDessert, and Snack.\\n• User constraints acquisition : The user was then\\nprompted to indicate any potential dietary con-\\nstraints. Initially, the system used an interface\\nwith a single checkbox for each of the most preva-\\nlent intolerances and allergies: Lactose, Meat, Al-\\ncohol, Seafood, Reflux, Cholesterol, Diabetes. Af-\\nterwards, the system asked the user to disclose a\\nlist of ingredients she could not consume.\\n• Preference elicitation : According to the con-\\nstraints specified by the user, the user was\\nprompted to submit preferences for five of the\\ndishes proposed by the system. Each dish was\\naccompanied with two buttons: “Like” and “Skip”.\\nThe skip option was provided to encourage users\\nto inspect an addition dish, which was retrieved\\nfrom the randomly sorted menu. The retrieval\\nwas based on a random active learning strategy.\\nThis way, users were encouraged to like five\\ndishes they were interested in, after which the\\nuser profile was built by the system.\\n• Processing: The system constructed theuser pro-\\nfile by analyzing the user’s five preferences from\\nthe previous stage. The cosine similarity was\\ncomputed between the user profile and each of\\nthe available foods in the catalog, to provide a list\\nof dishes from which recommendations would\\nbe selected. The algorithm also provided a list\\nof dishes ranked according to their healthiness\\n(based on their FSA score; see Section3).\\n1Code and recipe data used for implementing the chatbot are avail-\\nable athttps://github.com/giocast/MMCFRS\\n2A video demo of the three versions of our system is available at\\nhttps://tinyurl.com/mtzxr2sw',\n",
       " 'Figure 1: Our conversational recommender system flow.\\nFor each food category we built a matrix con-\\ntaining the TF-IDF representation (dish vs. ingre-\\ndient) of dishes in the catalog. The higher the\\nTF-IDF score, the greater the ingredient’s signifi-\\ncance to this dish (as opposed to other dishes).\\n• Recommendation and explanation : The system\\nprovided two personalized recommendations,\\nbased on the user’s preferences. The system con-\\nstrained the retrieval to ensure that the two op-\\ntions differed in terms of healthiness, so that one\\noption was healthier than the other. Thus, the\\nalgorithm provided a description of the suggested\\ndishes. Specifically, it explained why the second\\ndish was healthier than the first and why the ad-\\nvice was made. The user would then be prompted\\nto select one or request a new recommendation.\\nThe two recommended dishes were chosen using\\nthe following strategy: The first dish would be\\nthe most similar to the user profile, while the sec-\\nond dish (the healthier alternative) was selected\\nfrom a list of most similar dishes ranked on their\\nFSA scores, selecting the healthiest one (i.e. with\\nthe lowest FSA score).\\nThree different interaction modes were implemented\\nby modifying the values associated with the two manipu-\\nlatedvariables: interaction 𝐼 andexplanation 𝐸,according\\nto Table1.\\nIn thePure text version (T + T), the system communi-\\ncates with the user solely through text, displaying sim-\\nply the dish titles and offering textual explanations of\\nthe food recommendations. In theMulti-modal version\\n(MM + T), the system engages the user in a multi-modal\\nTable 1\\nDifferences between three implementations of the system.\\nInteraction Mode I E\\nPure text (T) T T\\nMulti-modal (MM) MM T\\nMulti-modal with labels (MM-Label) MM MM\\nmanner by displaying the name and image of each dish\\nthroughout the dialogue. However, the supplied explana-\\ntion remains textual. For the first dish, the explanation\\ncan be like ”I recommend these dish because I know\\nthat you have diet constraints due to: meat, zucchini.\\nThe first dish I proposed contains ingredients that you\\nmight like: carrot, lemon, tuna, olive oil”. For the sec-\\nond recommendation, the explanation further provides\\ninformation about macro nutrients quantities of the two\\nrecommended dishes and can be in the form of ”The\\nsecond dish I proposed has less calories (54 Kcal) than\\nthe first one (123 Kcal) and has less fats than the first\\none. The third versionMM-Label (MM + MM) likewise\\nemploys a multi-modal interaction approach, but it also\\nmakes use of nutritional explanations in the form of a\\nfront-of-package nutrition label with FSA’s Multiple Traf-\\nfic Lights (MTL) [25]. MTL nutrition labels depicted the\\nintake adequacy of a dish in terms of energy and nutri-\\ntional content, along five dimensions: energy (kcal), fat,\\nsaturates, sugars, and salt. This adequacy, per serving\\nand per 100g, was depicted using the colors green, yellow\\nand red, where green indicated a dish to adhere to the\\nnutritional intake guideline, while red indicated that the\\ncontent was unacceptable. These labels were generated',\n",

The recommendations were followed by textual ex-\\nplanations, based on the ingredients in the dish that the\\nuser likes. A comparative analysis of the nutritional facts\\n(e.g., ‘less sugars’) would also be provided. In theMulti-\\nmodal (MM) version, the system additionally provided\\nimages of the recommended dishes.

Even when only presented with a food image, humans\\ntend to instantly assess a food’s energy density, expected taste\\nand other characteristics [17]. As such, images are one of the key\\naffective determinants of food preferences [ 17, 19], tapping into\\nemotional and hedonic processes of an individual [2].\\nThe importance of visual attractiveness also applies to digital\\nchoice context, including food recommender systems [5]. Our pre-\\nvious research has shown the capability of recommender systems\\nto influence food behaviors via visual features, including the pro-\\nmotion of either high-fat or low-fat food choices [ 6], as well as\\nencouraging the search for healthier options [19]. Additionally, our\\nearlier work has established that visual attractiveness significantly\\ncontributes to predicting the online popularity of food items [20],\\nand these visual features can also be leveraged to infer cultural\\nbackgrounds [23]\\nWhat is currently missing is in-depth examination of image\\nfeature modelling. Although previous studies have extracted image\\nfeatures and examined the relation between image features, visual\\nattractiveness and user preferences [6, 19], these models have not\\nbeen optimized. Moreover, to date, image features have not been\\nrelated to user characteristics (e.g., demographics, food knowledge),\\nwhich are also important determinants of food preferences [15].\\nWe present the results of a mixed-method study that explores\\nthe determinants of visual attractiveness in digital recipe images\\nmore comprehensively. Our approach builds upon previous work by\\nmodeling perceived visual attractiveness based on low-level image\\nfeatures [10, 14, 19].

To our knowledge, no other work has\\nshown this before.\\n•Finally, this study tries to go beyond traditional quantitative\\nblack box approaches and reveals why images are rated less\\nor more attractive.\\n2 STUDY DESIGN\\nTo perform our study, we employed a dataset sourced from the\\nwell-known recipes website AllRecipes.com, with the addition of\\nnew recipe photos [4, 19]. The dataset comprised various recipe\\nfeatures, including image URL, ingredients, amount of fats and\\nsugar, and instructions and ingredients. To generate a diverse set\\nof images, we randomly selected 200 recipes with relatively from\\nthe dataset of 58,000. As most images in this dataset were relatively\\nunattractive [19], we used the recipe’s title in search engines and\\nimage websites (e.g., Unsplash) to look for more attractive images\\nfor 100 of these recipes. To validate this process, three computa-\\ntional food researchers, including a co-author, voted on which of\\nthe two photos was the most attractive to ensure a diverse set of\\nrecipe images in terms of expected attractiveness.\\nThe study involved a survey design, as depicted in Figure 1.\\nParticipants first provided demographic information, as well as\\nresponded to items that measured their subjective food knowledge\\n(4 items) and cooking skills (6 items), using 5-point Likert scales\\nbased on earlier work [7, 8, 12]. We also used questions from ear-\\nlier work on a knowledge-based food recommender [4], to inquire\\non other user characteristics, including recipe website usage and\\nhome cooking frequency, cooking experience and dietary goals.\\nAfterwards, users were invited to rate the visual attractiveness of\\n12 semi-randomly selected recipe images, on 7-point attractiveness\\nscales. In addition, to address [RQ3], they were asked to write at\\nleast one sentence about why they had given this rating. Finally, to\\nsupport our examination of [RQ3], we used 5-point Likert scales\\non food image dimensions [ 24], to ask to what extent a recipe’s\\nappearance, expected taste, healthiness, and familiarity affected\\ntheir attractiveness ratings.\\nWe employed the Prolific crowdsourcing platform to recruit 192\\nusers (65% male; 𝑀𝑎𝑔𝑒 = 33.54) to participate in our study. The\\nstudy took approximately 11 min to complete and participants\\nwere reimbursed with GBP 1.65 1.\\n3 RESULTS\\nTo address the research questions, we primarily employed linear\\nregression models to understand the principal impacts of image\\nattributes and user characteristics on image attractiveness derived\\nfrom user ratings. For our thematic analysis, the images were split\\ninto attractive and unattractive based on the mid-point of the rating\\nscale (4) ( 𝑀 = 4.33, 𝑆𝐷 = 1.80). Details of used materials and\\nconducted analyses can be accessed through the following URL [1].\\n3.1 RQ1: Predicting Visual Attractiveness\\nWe first modeled perceived visual attractiveness based on the under-\\nlying image features. We extracted diverse low-level visual features\\nusing the OpenIMAJ Java Framework (cf. [20]). Subsequently, we\\nconducted a linear regression analysis to predict attractiveness\\nbased on these extracted visual features. The results are outlined\\nin Table (1.A), revealing that several image features significantly\\naffected the attractiveness of a recipe image: 𝐹(8,2100)= 32.66,\\n𝑝 < 0.001. Specifically, Colourfulness, Brightness, Naturalness, and\\nEntropy demonstrated a positive association with image attractive-\\nness. In contrast, Saturation, Sharpness, and RgbContrast negatively\\n1Our study complied with the ethical guidelines of the Research Council of Norway\\nand the guidelines of University of Bergen for scientific research.

In line with [19], these results sug-\\ngested that users perceived colorful, bright, and naturalistic food\\nimages as more attractive.\\nGoing beyond low-level visual image features, we used deep\\nlearning architecture models. Our toolkit included established mod-\\nels, such as VGG16 [ 16] and ResNet [ 9], alongside the latest in\\nneural network architectures for visual feature extraction Clip [13].\\nTable (1.B) outlines the performance of these different models, out-\\nperforming our regression model in terms of 𝑅2 and RMSE. This\\naligns with previous research where deep learning embeddings\\nalso outperformed low-level visual features within the context of\\nfood [3, 20].\\n3.2 RQ2: User characteristics and Image\\nAttractiveness\\nWe further examined whether user factors affected the perceived\\nvisual attractiveness of images. Accordingly, we divided user char-\\nacteristics into different categories: User demographics, User profile,\\nwhich represented the backbone of a food knowledge-based recom-\\nmender system, and User knowledge, which measures the user’s\\nfood knowledge and cooking skills. A confirmatory factor analy-\\nsis, reported in Table 2, showed that both subjective food knowl-\\nedge and cooking skills adhered to internal consistency guidelines\\n(𝛼 > .70) while they also met the guidelines for convergent validity\\n(𝐴𝑉𝐸 > 0.5).\\nTable (3. A) presents the outcomes of the linear regression model\\naimed at forecasting the attractiveness of image recipes:𝐹(9,2090)=\\n3.60. Among the various user factors examined, only two signif-\\nicantly affected recipe attractiveness: cooking skills ( 𝛽 = 0.34,p-\\nvalue= 0.00021) and recipe website usage (𝛽 = 0.18,p-value= 0.020).\\nHowever, none of the other user aspects affected user ratings for\\na given image recipe. Additionally, we also analyzed a combined\\nmodel of image features and user factors, but this lead to results\\nsimilar to the separate models reported in Tables (1 and 3.A). This\\nsuggested that low-level visual features had a more significant im-\\npact on food image attractiveness than user features, largely in line\\nwith preliminary findings in previous research [19, 24].\\n3.3 RQ3: Justifications for Visual Attractiveness\\nTo assess the influence of different food image dimensions on user\\nratings for food images, we modeled visual attractiveness based on\\nthe reported importance of food image dimensions. Table 3 outlines\\nthe results of the regression model: 𝐹(4,21)= 2.41.\\nTwo factors significantly impacted attractiveness. First, appear-\\nance had a significant impact on user ratings (𝛽 = 0.12, 𝑝 = 0.03).\\nSecond, the expected healthiness from the images also demon-\\nstrated a significant impact (𝛽 = 0.07, 𝑝 = 0.03). However, perceived\\ntaste and familiarity did not show an impact on user ratings.\\nTo understand why user ratings of visual attractiveness, we exam-\\nined their qualitative justifications. We employed Natural Language\\nProcessing (NLP) techniques, including punctuation, repeated char-\\nacter and stopword removal, to analyze 2019 user justifications,\\ngiven to both attractive and unattractive images. Based on their\\nresponses, we generated a two word clouds that highlighted the\\nmost prevalent terms. Figure 2 shows the most frequent responses\\nfor both attractive and unattractive images. We discuss these, based\\non the themes ‘appearance’ and ‘health’ (cf. Table (3.B)).\\n3.3.1 Appearance-based justifications. Figure 3 shows a few exam-\\nples. Several participants, including user (U𝑎), expressed the term\\n‘Crispy’ in their assessments of attractive images, mainly referring\\nto appearance. The word ‘Simple’ is frequently used by users, such\\nas user (U𝑏), to convey the simplicity of recipe content. In con-\\ntrast, ‘mess’ was more commonly associated with judgments of\\nunattractive food images, indicating their unappealing appearance.\\nMoreover, the repeated use of the term ‘fat’ suggested that fatty\\nfoods were generally perceived as unattractive, as in judgments by\\nusers (U𝑐−𝑑).',\n",

Through an online user study, we have\\nfound that various visual features can predict the attractiveness\\nof a given image (i.e. colorfulness, brightness, naturalness). This\\nprediction accuracy could be slightly improved using image features\\nextracted using deep learning techniques (RQ1). In line with earlier\\nwork [14, 19, 24], this suggests that the visual attractiveness of food\\nimages can be enhanced by increasing their colorfulness, brightness,\\nand naturalness, while decreasing other features, such as saturating\\nand sharpness. Obviously, there may be tradeoffs between these\\nfeatures when altering them.\\nRegarding user characteristics, none of the user demographics\\nare related to food image attractiveness.
